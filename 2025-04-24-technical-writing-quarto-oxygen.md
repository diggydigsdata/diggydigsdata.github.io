This will be a small Technical Writing project. I will:

1. Document the steps for creating my Quarto website to be hosted on GitHub pages. I'll be basing it a little bit on the Just the Docs page, the Chirpy page and, especially, the actual Quarto page.
2. Using OxygenXml. I have a free trial, so I want to learn a little about it.
3. I may also incorporate some small reviews of different github pages jekyll themes I have tried, and why I have decided to change to Quarto.
