My name is Eoin, but throughout high school I was known exclusively as Diggy. I'm an MSc Data Science student (part-time) with an expected completion in 2027. My background is in ecommerce copywriting, teaching & special needs care. You can find my <a href="#resume">resume</a> below.

This site serves a few functions.

- First, it is a place to host projects and my resume. My objective is to work in data analytics, data journalism or technical writing. ***I've hosted my projects here prematurely. They are all in a draft phase. I just want prospective employers to see some things I am working on.***
- Second, it motivates me to flesh out data projects and practise Excel, SQL, Python and Tableau.
- Finally, it lets me experiment in the real world. I'll be building and embedding data visualisations, employing
VS Code, GitHub and Docker workflows, using markdown and HTML, and uncovering lots more things I need to know but haven't yet discovered. Every page and project is a learning experience.

This site hosts a fair chunk of *ancient* content from my university
days and the like. The purpose of adding this content is primarily to give me practise material as I structure the site and learn more sophisticated formatting in markdown and html. There are some bits and pieces which I am proud of, and lots more where I think the writing style is very undergrad and pretentious. Still, I have sentimental attachments there. All that stuff is tagged under <a href="/tags/ancient/">ancient</a>.
