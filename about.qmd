My name is Eoin, but throughout high school I was known exclusively as Diggy. I'm an MSc Data Science student (part-time) with an expected completion in 2027. My background is in ecommerce copywriting, teaching & special needs care. Here is my [resume](/assets/files/eoin-dignan-resume.pdf).

This site serves a few functions.

First, it is a place to host projects and my resume. My objective is to work in data analytics, data journalism or technical writing. 

Second, it motivates me to flesh out data projects and practise Excel, SQL, Python, PowerBi, Tableau, etc.

Third, it has forced me to develop Markdown influency and to understand static sites, version control and web publishing.

Fourth, it is a catalyst for new learning as I continuously discover new things I want or need for different projects.
