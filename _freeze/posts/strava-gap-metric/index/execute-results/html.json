By using GAP, runners can better compare paces across routes that have very different terrain profiles.\n\n::: callout-note\nGAP is a Premium Feature available only to subscribers.

You'll find it in the following places:\n\n::: callout-tip\n[Working on side-by-side screenshot of the GAP metric on a post-run analysis screen. There would be captions under each image: 'Mobile View 'on the left, 'Desktop View' on the right]\n:::\n\nYour run's analysis screen lets you evaluate your GAP across your full activity. You can even zoom in on key points for a closer look at your adjusted pace on any particularly nasty uphills.\n\nYour followers will also be able to view your GAP, so they can see how hard you really worked and give you the compliments you deserve.\n\n## How GAP Works\n\nThe GAP model uses two inputs: the grade of the terrain and the pace adjustment factor derived from physiological research.\n\n1. **Grade**:\n\n   Strava estimates the grade (steepness) throughout your run by using elevation data.  \n   See also: [Elevation](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216919447-Elevation)\n\n2. **Pace Adjustment Factor**:\n\n   Strava's Grade Adjusted Pace formula is based on research published in the Journal of Applied Physiology by [@Davies1974; @Davies1980; @Minetti2002]. Over time, Strava's engineering team has continued to build upon these studies. Broadly, the conclusions are:\n\n   - Effort is affected by the direction of steepness. Positive grades increase effort. Negative grades decrease it.\n\n   - Effort is affected by the level of steepness. In general, higher levels of steepness have larger effects on effort.\n\n   Crucially, however, Strava's analysis of athlete heart rate data has helped to quantify *how much* extra effort is expended on uphills or saved on downhills. For example, they found that:\n\n   - Downhills provide their greatest energy savings and pace increases at grades around -10%. Steeper than this, the positive effects begin to decrease.  \n   - At -18% downhills actually have a negative impact on your pace. This is because of a braking effect where runners must actively slow down.\n\n   By quantifying the relationship between effort and grade, Strava can apply a Pace Adjustment Factor that is based on grade. On perfectly flat 0% grade terrain, this factor will be 1.0.\n    \n   The full range of adjustment factors that Strava applies to grades from -30% to +30% can be seen on this graph:\n\n::: {#cell-fig-gap-model .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# 1.

Convert minutes/mile to seconds: $7 × 60 = 420$  \n2. Divide by the uphill factor: $420 ÷ 1.27 ≈ 331$  \n3. Convert back to minutes: $331 ÷ 60 ≈ 5:31$\n\nThe following table shows GAP values for common paces across different gradients.\n\n| Grade % | Factor | 6:00 mile | 7:00 mile | 8:00 mile |\n|--------:|--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|\n|  -7.5   | 0.89    | 06:45     | 07:53     | 09:01     |\n|  -5.0   | 0.90    | 06:40     | 07:47     | 08:53     |\n|  -2.5   | 0.95    | 06:19     | 07:22     | 08:25     |\n|   0.0   | 1.00    | 06:00     | 07:00     | 08:00     |\n|  +2.5   | 1.14    | 05:16     | 06:09     | 07:01     |\n|  +5.0   | 1.27    | 04:44     | 05:31     | 06:18     |\n|  +7.5   | 1.47    | 04:05     | 04:46     | 05:27     |\n\n::: callout-note\nGAP and Pace are identical on flat surfaces\n:::\n\n## How to Interpret\n\n🔺 **SCENARIO 1: You ran a net UPHILL route**  \n\n> **Average Grade:** +5.0%  \n> **Factor:** 1.27  \n> **Pace:** 7:00/mile  \n> **GAP:** 5:31/mile  \n\nYour pace was divided by a factor *greater* than 1 when you ran on uphill sections. This meant your GAP was faster than your Pace.\n\n⚡ **SCENARIO 2: You ran a net DOWNHILL route**  \n\n> **Average Grade:** −5.0%  \n> **Factor:** 0.90  \n> **Pace:** 7:00/mile  \n> **GAP:** 7:47/mile\n\nYour pace was divided by a factor *less* than 1 when you ran on downhill sections. This meant your GAP was slower than your Pace.\n\n⚖️ **SCENARIO 3: You ran a FLAT or BALANCED route**  \n\n> **Average Grade:** 0%  \n> **Factor:** 1.0  \n> **Pace:** 7:00/mile  \n> **GAP:** 7:00/mile\n\nYour pace was divided by 1 so it didn't change.\n\n::: callout-tip\nAlways check the elevation data. A route with constant ups and downs would be very tiring but could still result in a GAP which appears as if it were flat. For example, the Boston Marathon is notoriously challenging due to its uphill sections but is actually a net downhill course.\n:::\n\n## Limitations\n\n- GAP may indicate that a route was flat when it contained significant uphill and downhill sections.\n- GAP does not adjust for the fatigue caused by effort spikes or uneven pacing on undulating terrain.\n- GAP does not adjust for any other terrain features or technical difficulties, such as gravel. It only accounts for the gradient.\n- GAP does not adjust for the additional stress on joints of downhill running.\n\n## Golden Rules\n\nGAP is a helpful training tool. You can make more accurate assessments of your fitness level by minimising the confusion caused by hilly terrain. Just follow these golden rules to use it properly.\n\n**Use GAP when**:\n\n- Comparing your best 5 km times on different routes\n- Assessing fitness trends when you run on varied terrain\n- Benchmarking tempo run or interval times on new routes by comparing them to your old or existing routes\n- You have checked the Elevation profile to check if the route is Flat or Balanced\n\n**Don’t rely on GAP when**:\n\n- Running technical trails\n- Evaluating injury risk from downhills\n- Measuring pacing discipline\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n",
