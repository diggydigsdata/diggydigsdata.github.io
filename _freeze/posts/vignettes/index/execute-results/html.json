That's why we end up with nicknames like Penaldo. In fact, the BBC even stirred the pot when they captioned him 'Misstiano Penaldo' after he missed a penalty against Slovenia in 2024.\n\nIn this post, I look back in time to see: **what would goal totals look like if penalties were “allocated” back to the players who won them?**. And I also plan to build out a pipeline for current season statistics, so every penalty winner gets their fair share of the credit.\n\nWhat's the justification for this? There are a few.\n\nOne is that specialist penalty takers don't actually have penalty success ratios that are significantly above the average player. [point on roadmap - hypothesis testing this claim] This rebutes the argument that penalty takers deserve their goals because they are exceptional at taking penalties. No, most players are between\n\nSecond is that penalties are taking over the game, and it drives me crazy. If we look back through the history backs, we can see how inflated this has made goalscoring stats. For example, the average penalty ratio for the Pichici, Golden Boot and Capocannoniere follows this trendline. The influence of penalties has completely exploded statlines. There are vastly more penalties in the game today. See plot below. And I don't see that changing with VAR in the picture and the murkiness of handball rules.\n\nThe least we can do is to start giving credit where it's due. Timo Wener is a case in point. Much-maligned throughout his Chelsea career, his debut season's 2020-21 statline is actually pretty impressive when you peel back the penalties. He won 5 penalties in the Premier League and scored 6 non-penalty goals. He also racked up 8 assists. If he took the penalties he won at a rate of 0.757 success (the historical average), then he'd have 9.79 goals. Add in his 8 assists (I will discuss expected assists but let's park that for now) and he's up to 17.79 goal contributions from 2602 minutes, which is a goal contribution every 146.2 minutes. That's better than Chelsea's talisman and FIFA Team of the Year inclusion Cole Palmer during the 2024/25 season. Palmer notched 11 non-penalty goals and won 1 penalty, so we give him another 0.757. With 8 assists that makes 19.757 goal contributions in 3191 minutes of play, which is 161.5. Of course, these are my metrics. Their 'real' metrics are actually 138.7 for Palmer and 185.9 for Werner.\n\nThird, I would genuinely like to see penalty winners have to take the penalties they won. It's complicated in football because you have to assign the winner of the penalty. Though I have proposals for this. Nevertheless, it works in basketball.\n\nDid you know Raheem Sterling and Shaquille O'Neal have a lot in common?\n\nRaheem is the PL's greatest ever winner of penalties - with 26. Raheem is also one of the PL's greatest ever goalscorers; with 123 goals, he ranks 20th all-time. Meanwhile, Shaq is one of basketball's greatest ever free throw foul-drawers. He ranks 4th all-time:\n\n1.\tKarl Malone\t13188\n2.\tWilt Chamberlain\t11862\n3.\tLeBron James\t11735\n4.\tShaquille O'Neal\t11252\n\nSource: [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fta_career.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fta_career.html)\n\nBut Shaq and Raheem are also historically bad at converting the chances their drawn fouls create. O'Neal only succeeded with 52% of his attempts. In Premier League play, Sterling has converted 43%. That is abysmal considering the average success rate in the Premier League era is 78.9%.\n\nDespite Shaq's poor shooting from the free throw line, those points nevertheless helped him rack up the points. He is the 9th-highest scoring player in NBA history. Where would he rank if Kobe Bryant got to take all of Shaq's fouls?\n\nShaq wouldn't fall quite as far as you might think because he was so terrible at converting free throws. Neverthelss, if Kobe took all his fouls, people would foul him less but it would also make NBA scoring contests very dull. The same players would always top the statlines. Just like in football. Harry Kane has been excellent for Bayern Munich. But some of the hyperbole around his goalscoring is overblown. When you have Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala dribbling at defenders, you will win an extraordinary volume of penalties. And sure enough, Harry ended 2024/25 way out in front of the Bundesliga scoring charts with 26 goals. But he's not first if you take away everyone's penalties. That would be Patrick Schick (20), then Serhou Guirassy (18), then Harry (17), just ahead of Jonathan Burkardt (16) - who most people outside Germany have never heard of.\n\nDespite Sterling winning lots of penalties, he very rarely gets to take them. He has only taken 7 in the Premier League; typically, the ball was whipped away from him by Steven Gerrard (33 PL penalties converted at a rate of 80.5%), or Sergio Aguero (27 PL penalties scored for 81.82% success). Raheem currently ranks 30 in the all-time PL scoring charts with 123 goals. If he took all those penalties, where would he rank? And why stop there? Unfortunately, I don’t have PkWon data further back than 2016/17; otherwise, Alan Shearer’s PL goals record would be under threat from Andy Cole. Only 1 of Cole’s 187 PL goals came from the spot. Whereas 58 of Shearer’s 260 came from the spot. That's a 15 goal buffer. But Cole won a lot of penalties. Nevertheless, we’re going to rewrite the record books as much as possible.\n\nIf we use Raheem's non-penalty goals as a base (120) then add the only penalties he would be entitled to take - 26 - then work out his `PwxG`, or Penalties won to expected goals, he'd have scored 26 * 0.43 more goals or 11.18. Now on 131, he'd jump above Son, Anelka, Robbie Keane and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (all of whom took their fair share of penalties) and he'd sit in 16th on 134 PL goals, just behind Jamie Vardy. Oh wait, hasn't Jamie Vardy scored 27 penalties? But he only won 23 of them. So shouldn't his `G-PK+xPwg` be 27 * 0.82 based on his PL penalty success rate? He's only *entitled* to 22 penalty goals. So he loses 4 and he's down to 139 PL goals.\n\n| Player   | PL goals incl. pens | Non-pen goals | `PkWon` | PK Conversion % | `xPwG` | `G-PK+xPwG` |\n| -------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------ | ----------- |\n| Vardy    | 143                 | 116           | 23      | 82              | 18.81  | 134.81      |\n| Sterling | 123                 | 120           | 26      | 43              | 11.18  | 131.18      |\n\n>**Key:**\n>- `PkWon` = penalty kicks won  \n>- `xPwG` = expected penalties won goals, which is simply conversion % * `PkWon`  \n>- `G-PK+xPwG` = non-penalty goals + `xPwG`\n\nIt's enough for Vardy to hang onto 15th place, but you can see where this is going.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have `PkWon` data further than 2016/17; otherwise, Alan Shearer's PL goals record would be under serious threat from Andy Cole. Only 1 of Cole's 187 PL goals came from the spot. Whereas 58 of Shearer's 260 came from the spot. And Cole won a lot of penalties. Nevertheless, we're going to rewrite the record books as much as possible.\n\nSo what is this?\n- For now it's a Power BI demo dashboard that uses scraped data (see my guide to the ScraperFC pacakage) to let you explore the effects of PKWon at a single-season, single-comp level. But there's a lot more to come.\n\nRoadmap:\n- Add an API source for missing competitions (e.g., Champions League) and use cross-source checks. This is also necessary because FBref data is not designed for public projects.\n- Make the pipeline refreshable (weekly cadence) with validation + documentation\n- Rebuild the dashboard layer (likely Tableau later via MSc module or Streamlit or Shiny for Python)\n\nThis is both:\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## The question\nIf penalties were *allocated* to the player who won them, how much would goal totals and rankings change?\n\nI focus on Premier League-era data where `PkWon` is tracked:\n- **Penalty kicks won (`PkWon`)** comes from FBref.\n- For this first version, the goal is not “perfect truth”—it’s a **transparent, testable metric** you can disagree with.\n\n---\n\n## A simple metric: xPwG\nI use two quantities:\n\n- `PkWon` = penalties won\n- `xPwG` = expected goals from penalties a player won (allocated back to them)\n\nThen:\n- `G - PK + xPwG` = non-penalty goals + expected goals from penalties won\n\nIn the simplest version, `xPwG = PkWon × conversion_rate`.\n\nI also use a slightly more nuanced approach later (positional assumptions / bootstrapped league averages), but the key idea stays the same:  \n**reward the player who generated the penalty with an expected-goals value rather than giving them the full “goal” automatically.**\n\n---\n\n## Quick example: Sterling vs Vardy\n(Keep your table here.)\n\n> **Key**\n> - `PkWon` = penalty kicks won  \n> - `xPwG` = expected goals from those penalties  \n> - `G - PK + xPwG` = non-penalty goals + `xPwG`\n\nThis already hints at the broader point: some players “feast” on penalties others created, while some creators don’t get the credit.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology (short, readable)\n### Data\n- Source: FBref\n- Scope: PL seasons where `PkWon` exists (FBref only goes back to 2016/17 for PL `PkWon`)\n\n### Penalty conversion assumptions\nTo estimate `xPwG`, I use competition-level conversion rates from my penalty dataset (PL, La Liga, UCL, international shootouts).  \n(Keep your conversion-rate tables here.)\n\n### Why not just give them the full goals?\nBecause this is a counterfactual allocation problem:\n- we don’t know who would take penalties under a different rule\n- so `xPwG` is a conservative way to allocate credit while acknowledging uncertainty\n\n---\n\n## Dashboard (prototype)\nThis dashboard is a **demo layer** over the current dataset and metric definitions.  \nKnown limitations today:\n- currently scoped to a single season/competition in places\n- some interactions are still being tuned (cross-filter behaviour)\n\n<p class=\"pbi-wrap\">\n  <iframe title=\"fbref\"\n    src=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzY3ZGJmOWYtN2ZkYS00NzkxLWE4YzctN2U3ZmUyZTNhMjlkIiwidCI6ImE1MmIxMmI5LTdkYzktNGE3MS05YzQ5LTliZTkyOTIwNzAyZiJ9&pageName=7ac0fd6edc0a07143511\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    allowFullScreen=\"true\">\n  </iframe>\n</p>\n\n<style>\n.pbi-wrap { position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%; }\n.pbi-wrap iframe { position: absolute; inset: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; }\n</style>\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap (pipeline + reliability)\nI’m treating this as a pipeline project, not just a one-off analysis. Here’s the plan:\n\n### Phase 1 — Extend coverage (data completeness)\n- Add missing competitions (e.g., UCL) via a football API\n- Standardize competition + season keys\n- Create consistent “fact” grains (player×team×comp×season)\n\n### Phase 2 — Validation + repeatability (data trust)\n- Cross-source checks (API vs scrape): row counts, key uniqueness, spot checks\n- Data freshness and completeness checks\n- Document metric logic + assumptions clearly (so it’s reviewable)\n\n### Phase 3 — Refresh + product layer (usable outputs)\n- Scheduled refresh (weekly)\n- Publish outputs through:\n  - a dashboard layer (Power BI now; Tableau rebuild planned later), and/or\n  - a lightweight Streamlit explorer for exports\n\n---\n\n## Notes / limitations\n- `PkWon` availability limits historical scope.\n- Metric choices (e.g., conversion rates by position) are assumptions, not facts.\n- This is meant to be transparent: you can see the logic and disagree with it.\n\n\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe methods for calculating conversion rates for each player and allocating an `xPwG` get a little more exacting for my actual analysis. All of that awaits in the methodology. And then we'll be ee who the best players really were from a goal contributions perspective seeing who the best goalscorers really are if if we get rid of ball-snatching penalty-takers.\n\nNot much to say on the data. It's the 200 highest-scoring players in the Premier League for 2022/23 and a bunch of goalscoring metrics. It all comes from FBref, and this project is possible because they have a PKwon metric - they log who is responsible for winning each penalty. FBref only has this data for the Premier League as far back as the 2016/17 season. My tally from Raheem Sterling includes earlier years - I guess that data exists somewhere because Opta has an article about it. But I don't have those numbers. Anyway, for La Liga, FBref have it untl 2015/16.\n\nI've created a metric for this. It's not catchy, so bear with me.\n\n### **`xPwG`**\n`xPwG`, or Expected penalties won leading to goals, needs some unpacking. I have assigned a value of 0.75% to each penalty. Why?\n\n#### Penalty Conversion Rates\nFor another project - No Fear At That Age - I compiled penalty data from:\n\n- Every normal time penalty taken in the Premier League - in other words, since the 1992/1993 season\n- Every normal time penalty taken in the Champions League since the 1999/2000 season\n- Every normal time penalty taken in La Liga since the 1999/2000 season\n\nFor this project, I am adding:\n- Every penalty taken in the shootout of a major international tournament.\n\nInteresting that I have 7 less years from La Liga than the Premier League, but 64 more penalties.\n\n* The club data was taken from FBref while the international shootout data comes from [RSSSF](https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/penaltiestour.html)\n\n\n| **League**       | **Total Penalties** |\n| ---------------- | ------------------- |\n| Premier League   | 2892                |\n| La Liga          | 2956                |\n| Champions League | 925                 |\n| Int. Shootouts   | 1907                |\n| **Total**        | **6773**            |\n\nAnd when it comes to conversion rates, all three leagues are roughly equivalent:\n\n| Competition      | Conversion Rate (%) |\n| ---------------- | ------------------- |\n| Club Comps       | 77.99               |\n| Champions League | 77.19               |\n| Premier League   | 78.84               |\n| La Liga          | 77.40               |\n| Int. Shootouts   | 73.52               |\n\nUnsurprisingly, the international shootouts have worse conversion. Players are more nervous *and* many penalty takers are non-specialist; i.e. they don't take penalties for their club sides.\n\nHypothetically, if this new rule really came into place, then the specialist penalty takers would necessarily be the players who are most likely to win penalties - that is, attacking players. The data backs this up.\n\nThose players could assume they will win their fair share, whereas defensive players wouldn't. Specialisation would have to fall in line accordingly. Therefore, I will propose assigning a conversion rate based on player positions. *To Do: Get this into SQL so I can join datasets for each year and group by position. In addition, I need to group by position for penalty taking success*. Note: I will do a mini dashboard piece about success rate by position.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't added positional data for the datasets I downloaded. For wingers and forwards I will assign a value based on the specialists' average: - 78%. For everyone else the value will be based on a middle ground between specialists in club comps and the pressure cooker penalty shootout success rate - that middle ground is roughly 75.75%.\n\nThis means that an attacking midfield or forward player who wins a penalty will be treated a specialist and assigned 0.78 expected goals. Everyone else will get 0.7575 expected goals.\n\nLet's take an example. In 2023/24 Anthony Gordon won an extraordinary 6 penalties for Newcastle. As a winger, he gets a 0.78 expected goals value. That means his `xPwG` is 0.78*6, or 4.68 goals.\n\nOn the other hand, Jarrad Branthwaite won 1 penalty for Everton. He is a defender, so he gets 0.7575*1 for an `xPwG` of 0.7575 goals.\n\n### **`G-PK+xPwg`**\nIf we now take Anthony Gordon's non-penalty goals - 11 - and add his `xPwG` we get his `G-PK+xPwg`: 11+4.68. If Anthony Gordon took the penalties he won in 2023/24 we could expect him to score 15.68 goals.\n\nIn my analysis to come, I will also deploy `xAG` - expected Assists Leading to Goals. This is not a stat of my own invention and it's a close cousin of expected assists. I will quote the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6214991/2025/03/20/erling-haaland-assists-premier-league/) on this:\n>\"Where expected assists (xA) considers all passes and the probability that they may ultimately lead to a scoring chance, xAG solely focuses on the passes that directly contribute to an expected goal.\" \n\nmake sidebar: Shaq was so bad at shooting when 15 feet from the basket - a little over two Shaq's laid head to toe to head to toe - that a new tactic was invented: 'Hack-a-Shaq'. The idea was that if you simply fouled Shaq and put him at the free throw line, he would likely score less points - 1 from his 2 free throw attempts - than if you took the risk of letting the play continue because he'd probably manage to pivot and dunk for 2 points. So, if teams knew Kobe was stepping up with his 83.7% shooting then Shaq would have been hacked a heck of a lot less.\n\n<p class=\"pbi-wrap\">\n    <iframe title=\"fbref\"\n    width=\"600\"\n    height=\"373.5\"\n    src=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzY3ZGJmOWYtN2ZkYS00NzkxLWE4YzctN2U3ZmUyZTNhMjlkIiwidCI6ImE1MmIxMmI5LTdkYzktNGE3MS05YzQ5LTliZTkyOTIwNzAyZiJ9&pageName=7ac0fd6edc0a07143511\" frameborder=\"0\"\n    allowFullScreen=\"true\">\n    </iframe>\n</p>\n\n<style>\n.pbi-wrap {\n  position: relative;\n  padding-top: 56.25%;  /* 16:9 aspect ratio */\n}\n.pbi-wrap iframe {\n  position: absolute;\n  inset: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  border: 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n⚙️ Upcoming Table Fixes\n#\tFeature\tDescription / Action\tPriority\n1\tMinutes-weighted fairness rule for unattributed penalties\tUse player-minutes share to distribute team-level unattributed penalties fairly across players.\t🔴 High\n2\tRevert to assists (no xAG) for 2016/17\tReplace xAG values with raw assists in Hall of Fame tables for 2016/17 (xAG not tracked that year).\t🟠 Medium\n3\tSQL short_name column for teams\tAdd short_name field in dimteam to prevent text wrapping for long team names (e.g., “Borussia Mönchengladbach”).\t🔴 High\n4\tAdaptive PKW weighting by conversion rate\tWeight PKW by player conversion rate (pens_scored / pens_attempted), default 0.757 if no attempts exist.\t🟠 Medium\n\n🚀 Upcoming Features\n#\tFeature\tDescription / Action\tPriority\n5\tAdd UEFA Champions League 24/25 scraping feature\tExtend scraper to include UCL 2024/25 data and integrate into the main pipeline.\t🔴 High\n6\tTooltip linking unattributed PKWon info\tAdd hover tooltips linking to unattributed PKWon reference table (superseded by standalone visual).\t🟢 Low\n7\tReset bookmark (unfiltered state)\tConfigure a Reset button to restore default slicers via bookmarks.\t🔴 High\n8\tFix Hall of Fame visuals’ row-click response\tAdjust interactions / DAX filters so Hall of Fame cards ignore table-row selections.\t🟠 Medium\n9\tConditional formatting for awards\tAdd Ballon d’Or 🟡 and Golden Boy 👦 flags with icon-based formatting (superseded by dedicated award page).\t🟢 Low\n10\tCreate and integrate SQL views for Power BI\tCreate 4 SQL views (v_player_team_comp_season, v_player_team_comp, v_player_comp_season, v_player_overall) and link them into Power BI.\t🔴 High\n11\tStandalone visualisations (outside dashboards)\tBuild exportable visuals (trend lines, scatter plots, radar charts) for blog / static use.\t🟠 Medium\n12\tBallon d’Or comparison page\tAdd a Power BI page comparing Ballon d’Or-winning seasons — metrics for winners, runners-up, and non-winners.\t🔴 High\n13 Scrape current season data for all comps (CL, PL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1)\t🟠 High\n13\tLive build for current season (CI/CD)\tGitHub Actions workflow to run scraper daily, clean / load into DB, and refresh Power BI dataset automatically.\t🟠 Medium\n14\tFully automated Plotly Dash + embed\tLong-term goal: Dash app that fetches live data and regenerates visuals automatically — no Power BI refresh needed.\t🟠 Medium\n15 Re-scrape FBref for np expected goals data and add ratio of npgoals to npxg as calculated column\t🟠 High\n\n🧭 Upcoming Documentation\n#\tFeature\tDescription / Action\tPriority\n15\tDocumentation & rationale layer\tAdd detailed project docs (weighting rules, schema design, analytical logic, Power BI implementation, reproducibility).
