    "text": "Step 1: Setting Up Your Jupyter Environment\nIn this section, you will set up a JupyterLab environment using Anaconda Navigator, allowing you to write, run, and organize Python scripts within Jupyter Notebooks and scrape FBref data.\nTo use Jupyter Notebooks, you can use JupyterLab or VS Code. I prefer VS Code for general coding and I like the CoPilot integration. However, for data projects, I much prefer JupyterLab, which is accessed via the Anaconda Navigator. You can use VS Code and install Jupyter extensions. These combine to emulate JupyterLab. But I will not cover VS Code in this guide. Directory organisation, overall layout and previews are very intuitive within JupyterLab. Most importantly, VS Code is often very fussy about my Python packages and versions, etc. But JupyterLab just works.\n\nGo here: https://www.anaconda.com/download and enter your email address.\nSelect your Operating System and install Anaconda. It is free.\nChoose all the default settings during installation. Anaconda installs Python and many core Python packages such as NumPy and pandas, which we need for this project.\n\n Tip: Advanced users may prefer installing Miniconda instead of Anaconda. Miniconda is a lightweight version that only includes Python and the conda package manager. It saves disk space and gives you more control over which packages you install. However, it requires manually installing everything you need (including JupyterLab, pandas, and other libraries).\n\nOpen Anaconda Navigator from your start menu or desktop.\nLaunch JupyterLab from Anaconda Navigator\n\n\n\nScreenshot showing JupyterLab launch button in Anaconda Navigator\n\n\nJupyterLab will open in your browser. This may be unexpected but it is normal.\nOpen a ‘New Notebook’\n\nSelect kernel in the top-right. Verify that it is using Python3. If not, select Python3. Select the checkbox to save this preference.\n\n\n\nSelect a Python3 kernel and make it the default by checking the checkbox\n\n\n\nYou now have Python installed as well as many essential packages and a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can write scripts, explore data, manage your file structure and install additional packages."

    "text": "What do Raheem Sterling and Shaquille O’Neal have in common? Quite a lot, actually.\nRaheem is the PL’s greatest ever winner of penalties - with 26. Raheem is also one of the PL’s greatest ever goalscorers; with 123 goals, he ranks 20th all-time. Meanwhile, Shaq is one of basketball’s greatest ever free throw foul-drawers. He ranks 4th all-time:\nSource: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fta_career.html\nBut Shaq and Raheem are also historically bad at converting the chances their drawn fouls create. O’Neal only succeeded with 52% of his attempts. In Premier League play, Sterling has converted 43%. That is abysmal considering the average success rate in the Premier League era is 78.9%.\nDespite Shaq’s poor shooting from the free throw line, those points nevertheless helped him rack up the points. He is the 9th-highest scoring player in NBA history. Where would he rank if Kobe Bryant got to take all of Shaq’s fouls?\nShaq wouldn’t fall quite as far as you might think. See footnote about ‘Hack-A-Shaq’. It would make NBA scoring contests very dull. The same players would always top the statlines.\nBut that’s basically the case in football. Harry Kane has been excellent for Bayern Munich. But some of the hyperbole around his goalscoring is overblown. When you have Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala dribbling at defenders, you will win an extraordinary volume of penalties. And sure enough, Harry is way out in front of the Bundesliga scoring charts this season with 24 goals. But he’s not first if you take away everyone’s penalties. That would be Patrick Schick (17), then Harry (15), just ahead of Ermedin Demirovic (13) - who most people have never heard of.\nDespite Sterling winning lots of penalties, he very rarely gets to take them. He has only taken 7 in the Premier League; typically, the ball was whipped away from him by Steven Gerrard (33 PL penalties converted at a rate of 80.5%), or Sergio Aguero (27 PL penalties scored for 81.82% success). Raheem currently ranks 30 in the all-time PL scoring charts with 123 goals. If he took all those penalties, where would he rank? And why stop there? Unfortunately, I don’t have PkWon data further back than 2016/17; otherwise, Alan Shearer’s PL goals record would be under threat from Andy Cole. Only 1 of Cole’s 187 PL goals came from the spot. Whereas 58 of Shearer’s 260 came from the spot. That’s a 15 goal buffer. But Cole won a lot of penalties. Nevertheless, we’re going to rewrite the record books as much as possible.\nIf we use Raheem’s non-penalty goals as a base (120) then add the only penalties he would be entitled to take - 26 - then work out his PwxG, or Penalties won to expected goals, he’d have scored 26 * 0.43 more goals or 11.18. Now on 131, he’d jump above Son, Anelka, Robbie Keane and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (all of whom took their fair share of penalties) and he’d sit in 16th on 134 PL goals, just behind Jamie Vardy. Oh wait, hasn’t Jamie Vardy scored 27 penalties? But he only won 23 of them. So shouldn’t his G-PK+xPwg be 27 * 0.82 based on his PL penalty success rate? He’s only entitled to 22 penalty goals. So he loses 4 and he’s down to 139 PL goals.\nIt’s enough for Vardy to hang onto 15th place, but you can see where this is going.\nUnfortunately, I don’t have PkWon data further than 2016/17; otherwise, Alan Shearer’s PL goals record would be under serious threat from Andy Cole. Only 1 of Cole’s 187 PL goals came from the spot. Whereas 58 of Shearer’s 260 came from the spot. And Cole won a lot of penalties. Nevertheless, we’re going to rewrite the record books as much as possible."

    "text": "Methodology\nThe methods for calculating conversion rates for each player and allocating an xPwG get a little more exacting for my actual analysis. All of that awaits in the methodology. And then we’ll be ee who the best players really were from a goal contributions perspective seeing who the best goalscorers really are if if we get rid of ball-snatching penalty-takers.\nNot much to say on the data. It’s the 200 highest-scoring players in the Premier League for 2022/23 and a bunch of goalscoring metrics. It all comes from FBref, and this project is possible because they have a PKwon metric - they log who is responsible for winning each penalty. FBref only has this data for the Premier League as far back as the 2016/17 season. My tally from Raheem Sterling includes earlier years - I guess that data exists somewhere because Opta has an article about it. But I don’t have those numbers. Anyway, for La Liga, FBref have it untl 2015/16.\nI’ve created a metric for this. It’s not catchy, so bear with me.\n\nxPwG\nxPwG, or Expected penalties won leading to goals, needs some unpacking. I have assigned a value of 0.75% to each penalty. Why?\n\nPenalty Conversion Rates\nFor another project - No Fear At That Age - I compiled penalty data from:\n\nEvery normal time penalty taken in the Premier League - in other words, since the 1992/1993 season\nEvery normal time penalty taken in the Champions League since the 1999/2000 season\nEvery normal time penalty taken in La Liga since the 1999/2000 season\n\nFor this project, I am adding: - Every penalty taken in the shootout of a major international tournament.\nInteresting that I have 7 less years from La Liga than the Premier League, but 64 more penalties.\n\nThe club data was taken from FBref while the international shootout data comes from RSSSF\n\n\n\n\nLeague\nTotal Penalties\n\n\n\n\nPremier League\n2892\n\n\nLa Liga\n2956\n\n\nChampions League\n925\n\n\nInt. Shootouts\n1907\n\n\nTotal\n6773\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to conversion rates, all three leagues are roughly equivalent:\n\n\n\nCompetition\nConversion Rate (%)\n\n\n\n\nClub Comps\n77.99\n\n\nChampions League\n77.19\n\n\nPremier League\n78.84\n\n\nLa Liga\n77.40\n\n\nInt. Shootouts\n73.52\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the international shootouts have worse conversion. Players are more nervous and many penalty takers are non-specialist; i.e. they don’t take penalties for their club sides.\nHypothetically, if this new rule really came into place, then the specialist penalty takers would necessarily be the players who are most likely to win penalties - that is, attacking players. The data backs this up.\nThose players could assume they will win their fair share, whereas defensive players wouldn’t. Specialisation would have to fall in line accordingly. Therefore, I will propose assigning a conversion rate based on player positions. To Do: Get this into SQL so I can join datasets for each year and group by position. In addition, I need to group by position for penalty taking success. Note: I will do a mini dashboard piece about success rate by position.\nUnfortunately, I haven’t added positional data for the datasets I downloaded. For wingers and forwards I will assign a value based on the specialists’ average: - 78%. For everyone else the value will be based on a middle ground between specialists in club comps and the pressure cooker penalty shootout success rate - that middle ground is roughly 75.75%.\nThis means that an attacking midfield or forward player who wins a penalty will be treated a specialist and assigned 0.78 expected goals. Everyone else will get 0.7575 expected goals.\nLet’s take an example. In 2023/24 Anthony Gordon won an extraordinary 6 penalties for Newcastle. As a winger, he gets a 0.78 expected goals value. That means his xPwG is 0.78*6, or 4.68 goals.\nOn the other hand, Jarrad Branthwaite won 1 penalty for Everton. He is a defender, so he gets 0.7575*1 for an xPwG of 0.7575 goals.\n\n\n\nG-PK+xPwg\nIf we now take Anthony Gordon’s non-penalty goals - 11 - and add his xPwG we get his G-PK+xPwg: 11+4.68. If Anthony Gordon took the penalties he won in 2023/24 we could expect him to score 15.68 goals.\nIn my analysis to come, I will also deploy xAG - expected Assists Leading to Goals. This is not a stat of my own invention and it’s a close cousin of expected assists. I will quote the NY Times on this: &gt;“Where expected assists (xA) considers all passes and the probability that they may ultimately lead to a scoring chance, xAG solely focuses on the passes that directly contribute to an expected goal.”\nIf Kobe took Shaq’s free throws, he would tumble down the scoring charts. Although not by quite as much as you might expect. Shaq was so bad at shooting when 15 feet from the basket - a little over two Shaq’s laid head to toe to head to toe - that a new tactic was invented: ‘Hack-a-Shaq’. The idea was that if you simply fouled Shaq and put him at the free throw line, he would likely score less points - 1 from his 2 free throw attempts - than if you took the risk of letting the play continue because he’d probably manage to pivot and dunk for 2 points. So, if teams knew Kobe was stepping up with his 83.7% shooting then Shaq would have been hacked a heck of a lot less.\nShaq may be long gone, but this tactic has evolved into a huge problem for the sport.\nwould give him an additional which is a metric I have invented for this article.\nAnd yet, football might stand to learn something from it. No, I’m not about to propose that players deliberately foul each other, but the basic principle of NBA free throws - that the fouled player takes the shot, would be a fascinating addition to the sport. Moreover, I think it would allow for better performance comparisions and minimise the effects of statistics padding caused by players who feast on penalties that their team-mates have earned for them.\nLet’s just see what happens if we start retroactively giving penalties to the players who won them. We’ll use penalty conversion averages to change historical goalscoring statistics, and in the spirit of meritocracy, we’ll also be playing with xAG (expected assisted goals). Basically, the goal of all of this is to s\n\n\n\n\n\n⚙️ Upcoming Table Fixes # Feature Description / Action Priority 1 Minutes-weighted fairness rule for unattributed penalties Use player-minutes share to distribute team-level unattributed penalties fairly across players. 🔴 High 2 Revert to assists (no xAG) for 2016/17 Replace xAG values with raw assists in Hall of Fame tables for 2016/17 (xAG not tracked that year). 🟠 Medium 3 SQL short_name column for teams Add short_name field in dimteam to prevent text wrapping for long team names (e.g., “Borussia Mönchengladbach”). 🔴 High 4 Adaptive PKW weighting by conversion rate Weight PKW by player conversion rate (pens_scored / pens_attempted), default 0.757 if no attempts exist. 🟠 Medium\n🚀 Upcoming Features # Feature Description / Action Priority 5 Add UEFA Champions League 24/25 scraping feature Extend scraper to include UCL 2024/25 data and integrate into the main pipeline. 🔴 High 6 Tooltip linking unattributed PKWon info Add hover tooltips linking to unattributed PKWon reference table (superseded by standalone visual). 🟢 Low 7 Reset bookmark (unfiltered state) Configure a Reset button to restore default slicers via bookmarks. 🔴 High 8 Fix Hall of Fame visuals’ row-click response Adjust interactions / DAX filters so Hall of Fame cards ignore table-row selections. 🟠 Medium 9 Conditional formatting for awards Add Ballon d’Or 🟡 and Golden Boy 👦 flags with icon-based formatting (superseded by dedicated award page). 🟢 Low 10 Create and integrate SQL views for Power BI Create 4 SQL views (v_player_team_comp_season, v_player_team_comp, v_player_comp_season, v_player_overall) and link them into Power BI. 🔴 High 11 Standalone visualisations (outside dashboards) Build exportable visuals (trend lines, scatter plots, radar charts) for blog / static use. 🟠 Medium 12 Ballon d’Or comparison page Add a Power BI page comparing Ballon d’Or-winning seasons — metrics for winners, runners-up, and non-winners. 🔴 High 13 Scrape current season data for all comps (CL, PL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1) 🟠 High 13 Live build for current season (CI/CD) GitHub Actions workflow to run scraper daily, clean / load into DB, and refresh Power BI dataset automatically. 🟠 Medium 14 Fully automated Plotly Dash + embed Long-term goal: Dash app that fetches live data and regenerates visuals automatically — no Power BI refresh needed. 🟠 Medium 15 Re-scrape FBref for np expected goals data and add ratio of npgoals to npxg as calculated column 🟠 High\n🧭 Upcoming Documentation # Feature Description / Action Priority 15 Documentation & rationale layer Add detailed project docs (weighting rules, schema design, analytical logic, Power BI implementation, reproducibility).

    "title": "The Invention of Tradition",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The concept of ‘invention of tradition’ was introduced in a 1983 book of the same name edited by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger. They argued that neo-traditions (such as monarchy) were shaped in Europe during a period of rapid socio-economic change to induce membership of imagined communities bounded by ‘romantic nationalism’1 and engrained through mass ritual practice. These legitimized the authority of state institutions while investing them with meaningful symbolic power e.g. titles. Finally, neo-traditions normalized behavioural patterns consistent with broader objectification of societal roles, formulating class consciousness2.\nNeo-traditions constructed frameworks for social cohesion within emergent industrial nation-states. In imperial settings, such inventions were reproduced and implanted to manage and hierarchically classify diverse societies. The concept thereby proposes the reification of pre-colonial flux and fluidity3. Bernard Cohn sees this process dovetailing with the representation of colonial authority through co-opting, monopolizing and re-structuring the meaning of status symbols4. For imperialists, potency derived from the assumption that ‘traditions symbolise continuity, cultural identity and orderly existence’5. Subtle re-formulations maintain this continuity while fundamentally re-shaping societal composition to favour the now-mythicized imperial centre.\nThis essay will examine the formulation of colonial authority and prejudicial neo-traditions in Kenya and India. This was achieved by appropriating historical knowledge and rigidly defining identity and social hierarchy within the colonial idiom, such that caste was ‘constituted as the very condition of the Indian social’[^6]. By privileging the indigenous representation of neo-traditional knowledge social differentiation was expanded. Ranger acknowledges the inadequacies of the original concept in expressing the interaction between colonist and cultural collaborator. Therefore I will explore revised concepts which stress the indigenous manipulation and contestation of the ‘shifting symbols’[^7] of cultural knowledge within prejudicial spheres of discourse. These will be explored in detail through the exemplars of Kikuyu customary law and caste consciousness in India. Both the land-allocating tribal unit and the rigidly all-encompassing caste identity were embedded by the indigenous population in exigent response to these privileged idioms. The ‘invention of tradition’, I will conclude, served to institute hegemonic interpretations of history which formed the basis for class struggle and identity formulation. For this reason, their divisive legacy persists to the present day.\nCentralizing Authority\nBetween 1803-1858 Britain, as ‘protector’ of the Mughal Emperor, ruled India through mediated legitimacy, unable to assert authority through locally-appreciable status symbols. Following the Indian Rebellion (1857-1858), this need was reflected in increased concern for formulation of ‘racial identities and the balancing of religious identities in the interest of British rule’[^8], popularizing sociological, scientific and anthropological classification. Lord Lytton remarked that ‘“India would never be held by ‘good government’ alone”’[^9], and Britain re-oriented symbolic representations of social differentiation to transform ‘a system of authority based upon the incorporation of subordinates to the person of the emperor…[into]…an expression of linear hierarchic order’[^10]. Exerting control over the ‘fountain of honour’[^11], symbolism reflected contractual subjugation rather than alliance and normalized the inequities of imperial capitalism. African colonialism emerged later, reflecting ‘the effects rather than the causes of European invented tradition.’[^12] Natural disasters in the 1890s dispersed the Kikuyu, enabling colonials to institute widespread land alienation. Lack of pre-existing centralized ‘fountains of honour’ coupled with populous white settler communities necessitated increased mythicizing of ‘Imperial Monarchy’ and starker racial distinctions as legitimization of master-slave relations, exemplified by the kipande, the compulsory male symbol of servility[^13].\nHistorical Revision and Metaphors of Legitimization\nConsistent with Western nationalist conceptualization, Mill’s Oriental Despotism and Marx’s Asiatic mode of production, British ‘invention’ was legitimated by the assertion that India was a-historical, unchanging, oppressive, inherently spiritual and economically restrictive[^14]. She was susceptible to symbolic manipulation, consistently unable to self-govern and so diverse only an Imperial centre emanating a singular, objectified hierarchy could assure cohesion. The Imperial Assemblages represented colonial superiority by contrasting between the chaotic ‘other’ with the exaggerated, ordered gentility of settlers[^15]. As in 18th century India[^16], the Kikuyu were presented as ignorant of both individual land ownership and structured social organization. Despite refutation in 1912 by the Kiambu District Officer Mervyn W.H. Beech, colonials felt ‘recognition of a coherent system of land tenure among Africans would jeopardize the colonial project’[^17].\nHanlon reveals pre-existing social hierarchies[^18] and Bujra asserts the Mughal Empire was sustained by Indian entrepreneurialism; consequently a ‘high level of material culture and social organization had in fact to be destroyed’[^19]. Pre-colonial Kikuyu land allocation principles were multitudinous and diverse. Land was typically allocated through the mbari (kin collective) according to use. Uncultivated land belonged to the mbari and generally could not be individualised. Land accumulation depended on usage, as food surpluses funded labour. In this subsistence economy women were responsible for food crops. While land allocation operated on a patrilineal basis, females wielded significant influence. In Kenya, as in India, female oppression (clitoridectomy, caste) fulfilled a legitimizing function. Yet legal guarantees for women and migratory opportunities for young men ensured pre-colonial social differentiation was limited.[^20]\nMetaphors of Betterment (and subsequently Empowerment) were implemented in Kenya to service imperial capitalism. Betterment enforced the replacement of the staple food crop, millet, rich in protein and vital for pregnant women, with a uniform variety of maize. This cash crop produced higher yields of inferior nutritional value and was ill-adapted to the local environment. Maize contributed to social differentiation in four ways. Soil erosion destabilised those (predominantly women) reliant on on-farm income. Only the wealthy could afford to fallow. Secondly, from 1938 seed farms were monopolized by Local Native Councils, consisting of elders and wealthy males. Thirdly, wealth was generated through off-farm income inaccessible to women. Fourthly, prospective female opportunities from monetized maize economy encouraged emphasis on patriarchal control.[^21]\n‘Invention’ was operationalized in three ways. Firstly, by promulgating and legally codifying  historical re-representations. Liddle and Rai present a Foucauldian understanding stressing that ‘the possession of greater power generally invests the knowledges of the more powerful with a greater authority than those of the powerless…’[^22] Secondly, the objectification of society rigidly defined a ’”totalizing classificatory grid” of […] “paternalistic authoritarianism’”[^23], within which social and legal discourses were institutionally bound, thus reinforcing false histories. These components converged most decisively in the third element, cultural collaboration.\nCultural Collaboration\n‘All claims about community are claims about privilege, participation, and exclusion.’[^24]\nTo circumvent military intervention Britain delegated mediation of centralized symbolic hierarchies to cultural collaborators. In India the feudal ‘native aristocracy’ (Zamindars) who had demonstrated loyalty during the Indian Rebellion were increasingly peripheral, serving as revenue collectors and symbolic reminders of indigenous ruling inadequacies. Post-1860, management of diversity was achieved through codification of caste hierarchies. The Brahman elite were incentivized and privileged in upholding this construction. Kenyan patriarchal structures were upheld by chiefs, headmen and elders. However, Kikuyu customary law constitutes a decisive break from the essentialism of the original conceptualization, a ‘historical period in which […] traditions were peculiarly frequently invented rather than customs continuing to evolve.’[^25] Both Spear[^26] and Shadle[^27] argue that colonists retained law as deliberately adaptive and unwritten so that power within such an apparently dislocated and rapidly-changing society was exercised on a case-by-case basis, depicting a sub-state sphere managed through alliance with Loyalist ‘cultural brokers’. A more interactive understanding of ‘invention’ is therefore necessary.\nTerence Ranger’s 1993 self-critique, The Invention of Tradition Revisited, correspondingly acknowledges the concept’s earlier connotations as ‘too one-sided a happening’[^28]. He concludes ‘invention’ is an inferior term to ‘imagining’, proposed by Benedict Anderson. ‘Imagining’ stresses the intellectual agency of the colonized. Invention was rare; neo-traditions were imagined and subjected to repeated re-imaginings dictated by the interests of cultural mediators. Lentz introduces a richer understanding: ‘cultural brokers motivated by their own interests’[^29]. Chanock relates an over-arching understanding to Marxist conflict, stressing the divisiveness of economic disorder as a catalyst for strengthened collectivities, here predicated on fictitious histories and self-interest[^30]. While compelled to ‘imagine’ within neo-traditional discourses patronized by the colonists, collaborators occupied privileged positions in defining the resultant collectivities. Customary law and caste highlight more interactive and contested processes.\nCaste Consciousness\nPost-1860, orientalist assertions of intrinsic Indian spirituality became entrenched in society and nationalist thought. Scholars like Max Muller posited an inaccurate historical lineage distinguishing Aryan caste Hindus and non-Aryan peoples consisting of Muslims and low castes[^31]. Historical codification necessitated indigenous re-imagining. As in the Bengal Renaissance, natives seized upon positive depictions[^32] and incorporated them into national identity[^33]. This facilitated the simultaneous construction of caste as the definitive social identity buttressed by an all-encompassing Hinduism[^34]. Two-nation theory deemed Hindus and Muslims fundamentally incompatible and was exacerbated by nationalism expressed through Aryan Hinduism and Pristine Islam. Hinduism, and by extension India, was now defined racially.\nThe racializing of caste established Brahmans as purer Aryans, an elite middle-class with closer affinity to the colonists. Bujra believes caste classification racially and religiously legitimized inequality[^35]. As Brahmans constituted the priestly classes they were in a position to collaborate in defining theological representations. Caste reformists, often focussed on combatting gendered inequalities, ‘managed simultaneously to invoke ‘modern eugenics’ […] and the key principles of Brahamanical varna theory…’[^36] Census enumeration codified perceived associations between caste, race, occupation, ritual and social status, when the reality was diverse and dynamic. The census relied heavily on native volunteers (at least half a million) and codifications were highly interpretative; these native collaborators were the ‘literate and educated.’[^37] In 1901, these caste classifications became an ordinal structure of social precedence. Census administrators replaced the ‘absence of a uniform system of classification […with…] an all-India system of classification of castes.[^38]’ As the concept of Four Varnas became law and caste identities became legal identities, H.H. Risley rendered social precedence inseparable from ritual; diverse and disparate communities became legally bound to the fulfilment of uniform ritual practises.[^39] Sankritization, or Brahman ritual emulation, was the primary route for social mobility.[^40] Refutation of Brahmans’ objectified superiority did not transcend the colonial discourse. Rather, Thapar demonstrates that orientalist-inspired arguments were merely re-interpreted, with Brahmans depicted as earlier colonists.[^41]\nCarroll argues that caste-cluster consciousness was an unanticipated evolution emerging from increased orientalist conceptualization of caste. Since caste became intrinsically linked with government patronage, employment, access to education and political positions, communities were compelled to assert false histories to scale the hierarchies ‘imagined’ by the colonists.[^42] Ritually, historically and economically embedded, these became the backbone of social identity. Arising through social necessity caste organizations were arranged in response to new legal identities and British demands of uniformity. Organizations often began by denying the scheme’s validity, but concluded with broad assertion of status on any proposed classification. To appeal their caste classifications, claimants drew heavily on Western historical records.[^43] Thus, caste and status were re-negotiated within the fixed and privileged parameters of colonial idiom and historical revisionism. Classificatory schemes provided intellectual elites opportunity to define, consolidate and expand pre-existing status differentials.[^44]\nCustomary Law\nCustomary law was established as a forum distinct from settler courts through which Kikuyu could resolve, and thereby de-politicize, land grievance. In 1910 colonial administrators decreed that ‘elders were to become the interpreters of “tradition” which, having “lost its significance”, was to be “built up” with “government support”[^45]. Over two days in 1920, discussions took place with prominent local elders, exclusively male. Colonists derided land law ambiguity, exclusively acknowledging allocative rights and by the inquiries of 1929 and 1932-34, the Kikuyu had re-imagined ‘tradition’ within colonial legal parameters. Kikuyu identity now synthesized with Mbari territoriality[^46]. In reality, both were ‘imagined into existence’[^47]. Tribal heterogeneity, and ‘the “porosity” or permeability in customary law, was muffled at a time when corporate control was increasingly under threat’[^48]. Within these boundaries Mbari land allocation was privileged to the total exclusion of land use, effectively denying the rights of women and young males. Moreover, as women worked the land, men were free to engage in more lucrative off-farm activities. Customary roles were retained while legal rights were re-formulated. Female claims to customary law were rejected by elders[^49] and the pre-colonial ‘legal fiction’[^50] by which females were excluded from patrilineal land ownership became consolidated.\nThe motives of ‘re-imagining’ are evidenced by the 1944 Local Native Council decree that all past land sales exceeding ten goats were now deemed irredeemable, facilitating both future accumulation and reclamation of land worked by other, usually young, farmers. Thus, the ‘shifting symbols’ of un-codified custom were systematically prejudiced by an ‘alliance of colonial and African patriarchy to produce a ‘customary law’ which firmly put women and juniors in their subordinate place.’[^51] Evidence of widespread corruption highlights the extent to which wealth influenced the composition of ’tradition. Indeed, political parties such as KANU, the post-independence ruling party fronted by Kenyatta originally formed as wealthy land-acquiring blocs[^52].\nAs with caste classification, ‘reverse discourses’[^53] were constructed to contest social differentiation within ever-tightening colonial parameters. Appeals courts were widely used to delay eviction and patrimony could be contested within the Supreme Court. But such efforts were increasingly stifled. As culture was commodified, so too were social relations. Recourse was pursued through such practises as female husbands, where women acted as surrogate male kin for those past childbearing age. Restrictions could be circumvented through inventive understandings of the law, or on occasion by operating outside it. Women toiled to raise millet for local sale, or travelled huge distances to sell small surpluses on the emerging black market.\nSocial differentiation pre-existed colonialism, Berman shows[^54], yet was expanded and consolidated through the privileged exploitation of traditional discourse within the parameters of reified hierarchy; ‘the mbari…was recreated as a means of individual accumulation, and to mask class struggle.’[^55] In the prejudiced contestation of power over these decisive re-imaginings, the subtext of class conflict and collective negotiation finds its richest sociological understanding in Gramsci’s theory of hegemony. Here, culture constitutes a ‘battleground where social values and relations are shaped, represented and contested’[^56]. Colonial hegemony was not absolute, but distributed across local collaborators by privileging authority over contestable meaning within discourses over which it could not dictate the evolutionary endpoints[^57]. Even where power over ‘imagining’ is institutionally privileged and idiomatically bounded there are avenues of negotiation. And often there was no choice but to pursue them.\nPost-Colonial Pathways\nThe narrative of Kikuyu land alienation and the ‘re-imaginings’ of land relations by ‘cultural brokers’ defines the Kenyan transition to independence. The seminal moment in Kenyan nationalism is the Mau Mau rebellion (1952-1960), now viewed as an intra-Kikuyu class war between the Loyalist petty bourgeoisie opportunism and the exploited landless[^58]. Despite the invented colonial parameters of tribal affiliation, ‘the significance of being ‘Ndebele’ or ‘Kikuyu’ was bound to be a matter of internal struggle. Its imagination could not be left to the patriarchs.’[^59] Loyalists would dominate Kenyan politics post-independence, erasing Mau Mau from the nationalist memory: ‘leaving its legacy to the imaginings of ‘the poor, the landless, and the opponents of the capitalist development path followed by successive post-colonial regimes…’[^60] Land grievances arose immediately. KANU won an ethnically-charged election and Kenyatta recovered 40% of settler land for his dispossessed Kikuyus, 20 per cent of the population[^61]. He retained colonial bureaucratic structures, together with its individualist capitalism, albeit under the populist imagining of African Socialism. His decision belied an economic strategy replacing the settler-colonist relationship with a bourgeois-proletariat one[^62]. The ensuing one-party era was dogged by land misappropriation, often linked to ethnic identity, and a factor in the 2007 violence against Kikuyu hegemony[^63]. The inequalities consolidated by customary law continue to subjugate women.[^64]\nIndia provides a striking contrast, superficially. Gandhi’s First Non-Cooperation Movement, advocating absolute rejection of British representations of authority and a refusal to participate in its incentivizing structures[^65], was the catalyst for independence. However, nationalism defined itself in response to the colonists, sustaining the orientalist spirituality that upheld fictitious and damaging aspects of the Varna caste structure. Gandhi’s Indian National Congress, as successful contestant of the independence struggle, has ruled for long periods as a one-party state within a broader political landscape haunted by the ‘spectre’ of caste  (Dirks pg. 17). Within 30 years, communal politics brought the secession of Pakistan and Bangladesh along the ethno-religious conflict lines legitimized by British historicity. Caste consciousness survived independent colonial classification and patronage. But since the 1990 Mandal Commission Report, the discourse has been inverted. Today, Backward Castes are privileged. In response, Aryan castes argue caste identity should be subjugated to a broader, Hindu one.[^66]\nConclusion\n‘Invention’ is an illuminating starting point, but the concept is partial and incomplete. It benefits from more interactive theoretical appreciations of colonial structure and indigenous agency. Colonials regulated the discourses within which power was ‘imagined’, consolidated and contested (engaging ‘reverse discourses’) by indigenous actors. In Kenya customary law was legally compelled to adapt to colonial structures of patriarchal individualism. In India, a synthesis of social, religious and economic existence embedded a newly-objectified hierarchy within idioms of race, religion and nation. Pre-colonial classificatory schemes already existed, particularly in India, and colonials distorted historical knowledge to regulate privileged access to essentialist frameworks; legal, historical and mode of production. ‘Cultural brokers’ served as privileged interpreters of tradition, sustaining bounded identities by ‘creating fictional collectivities in the pursuit of individual rights.’[^67] These were consolidated through ritual, race and status. Contestation re-enforces these new manifestations of identity. Valid conceptualizations must acknowledge the integral role of intellectual agency in embedding these structures. Such an understanding reconciles Dirks and Washbrook by demonstrating that colonial knowledge discourses were a platform for indigenous capitalism[^68]. They would not have proven so enduringly divisive otherwise. Applied with reference to discourse theory and Gramscian hegemony the concept represents a valuable post-Marxist analytical tool. Consistent with Laclau and Mouffe’s analysis[^69], where neo-traditional knowledge discourses were patriarchal, hegemonic and privileged, classes were not a rigid cause of hegemony but could themselves be the invention. Colonists drew the fault lines within which indigenous ‘re-imaginings’ consolidated class struggle and formulated identity. ‘Tradition’ articulated, or upheld, through privileged actors legitimized, reproduced and divisively embedded these commodified knowledges in the socio-economic landscapes of Kenya and India.\nBibliography\nBarkan, J (1994), ‘Divergence and Convergence in Kenya and Tanzania: Pressures for Reform’, in Joel D.

    "section": "Justification and Contextualisation",
    "text": "Justification and Contextualisation\nFour readings have guided my thinking on the subject and compose a chronological context for the study. Foremost among them is, of course, the chapter by Richard Breen in the 1996 Report on Social Attitudes in Northern Ireland. There is obvious justification for the repetition of survey methods for the purposes of longitudinal comparative studies. Of particular relevance, therefore, to my own study was the development of a chronological framework; the following literature supported my proposal.\n\nGoverning Without Consensus (1971) by Richard Rose4\n\nThe book consists of three parts. Firstly, the context and theoretical framework, in which he traces the development of a discordant political system and its inability to forget the past and efforts to make sense of it. Secondly, Rose designed his own ‘Loyalty Survey’, which achieved a remarkably high response rate (86.2 per cent) and used trained interviewers to gather data from around 1300 households. The results demonstrate how the majority of people were considering Ulster’s situation as separate from Britain; it was its own complex entity in a way. The results are surprising given the escalation of tensions that quickly followed. The final part deals with potential constitutional outcomes. He offers 12.\n\nInterpreting Northern Ireland (1990) by John Whyte5\n\nWhyte accumulated a vast array of survey findings charting changes in self-identification at fairly regular intervals. In this way, his objectives are very much in keeping with my own. It is further enlightening in the sense of showing the different methods employed by sociologists to determine measures of religiosity and of cultural, social and political identification. Based on my reading, it would appear that this practice of re-treading questions is not unprecedented. In fact, the situation seemed to justify it, particularly in light of the unpredictable social context. Indeed, Moxon-Browne explains that he used the same key questions in his 1983 book ‘Nation, Class and Creed in Northern Ireland’ based on a 1978 survey as Rose had done 10 years earlier. There is a parallel to be drawn to my own proposed study. Rose used a survey that was carried out just months before the Troubles really began, and Moxon-Browne was in a position to assess what 10 years of escalating tensions had done to identity.\n\n‘National Identity’ (1991) by Edward Moxon-Browne6\n\nMoxon-Browne adopts a similar tone to Breen. ‘Although the lines of division are often considered to be religious in character, religion is best seen as a badge of difference - the visible symbol of deeper and less tangible attachments to national ’roots’. Today, these conflicting interpretations manifest themselves in two sets of apparently irreconcilable political aspirations.’ However, he elaborates more on why that may be the case and proposes that endogamy and insularity have been core to the prolonged segregation and political polarization. One interesting point he makes: ‘In 1968, just before the onset of civil unrest in Northern Ireland, 20% of Protestants claimed to feel ’Irish’. Ten years later, after having borne the brunt of the IRA campaign, Protestants have swung more definitely towards adopting the label ‘British’. This causes me to wonder what effect the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and the sustained period of peace will have had on identity.\nSimilarly, whereas Breen identifies no conclusive evidence for the influence of class Moxon-Browne is adamant that towards the end of the 1970s class was a factor in identity, or at least the intensity with which identity was expressed. He points to a fading away of this influence, one which may be slow-burn. Given the closing of the gap in recent years changes may be evident in the surveys I’ll be dealing with.\nSince Breen’s study concluded in 1994, the political landscape in Northern Ireland has undergone drastic re-formulation. More than ever, it seems, a balanced assessment of Northern Ireland’s constitutional driving forces is possible. From the late 1980s talks had been ongoing over ways to resolve the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland but it was not until April 1994 that the Provisional IRA instituted a three-day ceasefire. By 31 August a permanent ceasefire was promised. After a period of dialogue and a stop-start period of hostilities followed by ceasefires, Northern Ireland’s major political parties finally appeared to unite in their commitment to peace with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, followed shortly by the election of a Northern Irish Assembly in 1999. The formation of a devolved Northern Irish executive represented an end to Direct Rule from London for the first time since March 1972. Devolution took time to settle, but Northern Ireland now has a functioning Assembly with a cross-community Executive. Departments are allocated in proportion to number of seats held. Most recently, there has been an unprecedented cross-community collaboration between DUP and Sinn Fein.7 This belies, therefore, the shift towards the more extreme wings of the political spectrum.8\nThe issues I hope this updated study will illuminate are, therefore, whether these changes have re-shaped ethnic national identities in Northern Ireland. This will be gauged principally by constitutional preferences, most significantly the support for either a United Ireland or for some form of Union with Britain. Consequently, I will adopt a more focussed approach than Breen, centring my examination on the Catholic constitutional preferences, by way of investigating the desire for a United Ireland, and its potential re-evaluation in light of a devolved government. It is tempting to say that the strength of ethnic/national identity can be eroded as issues around which conflict centres diminish in strength. Economic growth, and the decrease in violence may have softened relations. What makes the topic potentially so fascinating, then, is that the parties elected to forge these alliances are the most extreme wings of Northern Ireland’s unique political spectrum. In other words, I want to see why the period of greatest compromise has coincided with the rise of the most unrelenting of the political parties; namely Sinn Fein and the DUP. They have established their mainstream credentials by being entrusted with the task of working together.\nThrough a through statistical deconstruction of Catholic identity I hope to be able to arrive at a more rounded appreciation of the extent to which religion determines the constitutional preferences because it seems as though, in accepting compromise and prioritizing autonomy, even in the most rudimentary sense of the word through devolution, there must be recognition of something beyond religion as the driving force in an evolving complexity of constitutional realities."

    "text": "Methodology\nThe practicalities of my project were modelled on the Breen study. Obviously, certain constraints ensured I adopted a more focussed approach.  Breen used the NI Social Attitudes Survey, from 1989-1994, with the exception of 1992 when there was no survey910 From 1998, this has been replaced by the NI Life and Times Survey.11 The central justification for my update is my desire to assess the impact of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. A subsequent landmark moment in terms of the Northern Irish constitutional arrangement arrived in the aforementioned power-sharing agreement of 2007. To arrive at logical conclusions, it appeared necessary to merge time periods in order to serve as broader points of comparison. So, 1989-1994 equals Breen’s years, 2000-2004 is the post-GFA period, noteworthy also because all the variables in the surveys from these years remain consistent with those established during the course of Breen’s study. Finally, 2007-2008; not only does this correspond with power-sharing and is a reflection on the present-day situation, it also sees a tweaking in the constitutional preference question, rendering it somewhat more positive with regard to the union with Great Britain, in a way which may be encouraging to Catholics.\nData was gathered from two sources; the NI Social Attitudes Survey (1989-1998), the subsequent NI Life and Times Survey (1998-2008). A pooled dataset comprising 1989-2004 was sourced via the UK Data Archive.12 The remaining datasets were downloaded from the NILTS website. The datasets were then stacked one on top of each other using the SPSS merge procedure. The pooled file did not have all the same variables as did NILTS, most notably the variable for main religious affiliation i.e. Catholic, Protestant, no religion – RELIGCAT, however a recode of religious denominations was able to produce this variable. Furthermore, it had three supplementary datasets relating to Northern Irish elections which it was necessary to exclude. Table 1 illustrates the sample sizes for each year. Between 1989-1994 the total count is 5029; for 2000-2004 it is 9000 and for 2007-2008 it is 2394. Post-2004 the size of the survey has decreased from 1800 to 1216 in 2008 due to lack of funding. In 2008, the most recent survey, the NI Life and Times Survey reported a response rate of 60%, perhaps low enough to leave it vulnerable to non-response bias.\n\nTable 1: Sample Size Per Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nFrequency\nPercent\nValid Percent\nCumulative Percent\n\n\n\n\nNISA 1989\n86\n3.4%\n3.4%\n3.4%\n\n\nNISA 1990\n89\n3.6%\n3.6%\n7.0%\n\n\nNISA 1991\n90\n3.6%\n3.6%\n10.6%\n\n\nNISA 1993\n84\n3.3%\n3.3%\n14.0%\n\n\nNISA 1994\n151\n6.0%\n6.0%\n20.0%\n\n\nNISA 1995\n151\n6.0%\n6.0%\n26.0%\n\n\nNISA 1996\n78\n3.1%\n3.1%\n29.1%\n\n\nNILT 1998\n1800\n7.2%\n7.2%\n36.3%\n\n\nNILT 1999\n2200\n8.7%\n8.7%\n45.0%\n\n\nNILT 2000\n1800\n7.2%\n7.2%\n52.2%\n\n\nNILT 2001\n1800\n7.2%\n7.2%\n59.3%\n\n\nNILT 2002\n1800\n7.2%\n7.2%\n66.5%\n\n\nNILT 2003\n1800\n7.2%\n7.2%\n73.7%\n\n\nNILT 2004\n1800\n7.2%\n7.2%\n80.8%\n\n\n2005\n1200\n4.8%\n4.8%\n85.6%\n\n\n2006\n1230\n4.9%\n4.9%\n90.5%\n\n\n2007\n1179\n4.7%\n4.7%\n95.2%\n\n\n2008\n1215\n4.8%\n4.8%\n100.0%\n\n\nTotal\n25149\n100%\n100%\n100%\n\n\n\nSurveys were carried out through face-to-face interviews and self-completion, using random sampling to select persons aged 18+ living in private residences. For the purposes of ensuring a representative sample, the surveys only use one adult from each selected house. So, in houses with multiple adults one person is randomly chosen for the survey. Consequently, it is necessary to use weighting to account for the lower probability of selection in larger households.1314\nThe study demands an investigation of the religious background of all the respondents. This is derived from the RELIGCAT summary variable based on the question on ‘religious denomination’. This will serve as the independent variable underlining my ability to make assessments on the influence of religion on the following dependent indicators of identity:\nConstitutional preferences. This variable is measured by the question ‘Do you think the long-term policy for Northern Ireland should be for it to remain part of the United Kingdom or to reunify with the rest of Ireland?’. For the 2007 survey, the question was changed. Respondents were asked if they wished to remain part of the UK either with direct rule i.e. governed from London, or with devolved Government i.e. the NI Assembly and Executive. This devolved option is a sort of halfway house, offering Catholics a slightly more attractive proposition perhaps and complicating comparisons.\nNational identity. This variable is established through the question ‘which of these best describes the way you usually think of yourself? ‘British’, ‘Irish’, ‘Ulster’, ‘Northern Irish’ ‘other’.\nConstitutional identity. This variable is introduced through the question ‘Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a Unionist, a Nationalist or neither?’ The responses are therefore quite straightforward and easy to operationalise.\nPolitical party preference-this variable (NIPTYID4) is derived from the answers to two questions:\n“If there was a general election tomorrow, which party would you vote for?” (NIPTYID1This is for 1989-2004).\nThen, for those who answer non-NI parties (Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats), asks:\nNIPTYID3: “If there were a general election in which only Northern Ireland parties were standing, which one do you think you would be most likely to support?”\nIn 2007 and 2008, the survey switched to asking “Which party do you feel closest to, even if you do not always vote for them?” (POLPARTY). With the latter question, it may be easier for people to say ‘none’. Strictly speaking, therefore, they are not comparable.15\nThe defining feature of my study is that Northern Ireland has undergone change, and that perhaps the findings of Breen will not necessarily hold hard and fast in the present economic and political climate. For this reason, it is necessary to investigate another factor in determining identity in Northern Ireland. That is, social class. For a long time, it would have been held that social class in Northern Ireland was also determined exclusively by religion and that opportunities were limited for Catholics. However, this can no longer be stated unequivocally. For this reason, it is possible that all along social class has been the primary indicator of constitutional preferences, it was merely obscured by its inherent historical ties with religious identity. I am interested to see whether different elements of society support different constitutional options. Perhaps this will prove at least as important as religion in determining the way Northern Irish envisage their future.\nSocial class-as a social class indicator Breen used RGHCLASS, the Goldthorpe-Heath schema.16 In 2007 and 2008 the NS-SEC Analytical classification is used.17 Unfortunately, the latter is too much of a revision on the former to derive a common variable. In spite of this, Breen’s categories can be viewed as similar in terms of a social class rank order. In this, Breen’s ‘salariat would correspond to ‘professional and managerial’, for example."

Hardly surprising, support for a United Ireland is derived from Catholic quarters, while support for Union with Britain is supported overwhelmingly by Protestants. However, further investigation suggests there may be factors at play beyond simply religion. For example, in the case of Catholics note the increase in don’t knows from 6-7% from 1989-1996 up to around 17-20% from 1999 to 20046 . Similarly, Protestants experience a surge in uncertainty, from 1.4% at the outset to 6.4% by 2004. In both cases, the uncertainty seems to resolve itself somewhat, returning to normal levels by the time of the 2007-2008 NILT surveys. This is not reflected in the ‘not answering’ column, which perhaps suggests that’s while people are engaged with the issue, they are unsure how best to articulate their feelings within the confines of the survey options. There is, moreover, a sharp increase in the same time periods for those saying Other - up from 2-4% to double digits. The most obvious explanation would be that the shifts are caused by the modifications in the question formatting in NILTS compared to NISA. In these most recent surveys, the option of devolution was presented. In that sense, the anomaly may be simply an artefact of the administration of the survey. However, contextually speaking, there seems sufficient cause as to whether political developments were influential. 2000-2004 represents the immediate run-up to devolution. By 2007-2008 the power-sharing accord was beginning to look increasingly likely and people would have had to come to terms with its impendency.\nIt is pertinent, therefore, to question whether this apparent willingness to embrace devolution is indicative of a softening in national self-identification among Catholics. Table 3 is a revised version of Breen’s Table 3, which was entitled ‘Responses to national identity question by religion and year (%).’\n\n\nTable 3: Catholics: Responses to National Identity Question by Religion and Period (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nBritish/Ulster (%)\nNorthern Irish (%)\nIrish (%)\nTotal (%)\nCount\n\n\n\n\n2000-2004\n10.3\n26.4\n63.2\n100.0\n3292\n\n\n2007-2008\n9.7\n29.0\n61.3\n100.0\n920\n\n\nTotal\n10.2\n27.0\n62.8\n100.0\n4212\n\n\n\nContrary to Breen, I used a filter so that the table features only the Catholic responses. In Breen’s study, Catholic self-identification is remarkably consistent, with an average of 61.25% over the 4 years citing themselves as Irish. There is a variation of only 2 per cent over the course of his study. Similarly, they identify themselves as Northern Irish/Sometimes British, Sometimes Irish with a range of between 26 and 29 per cent, and between 10 and 13 per cent identifying as British/Ulster. In spite of the peculiarities of the previous table this consistency in self-identification continues without anomaly in my own updated studies. Indeed, there is a very slightly strengthening in attitudes, with 62.8 identifying as Irish on average between 2000 and 2008. As is highlighted by chi-square in the answer to this question Catholics are demonstrating no significant change in identity.\nPerhaps of even more significance with regard to the increase in support for devolution is the constitutional identity of Catholics. Are people espousing nationalism at the same time as witnessing the embrace of the possibility of evolution? Table 4 addresses this issue, classifying Catholics based on their support for Unionism, Nationalism or neither.\n\n\nTable 4: Catholics: Responses to Constitutional Identity Question by Period (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nUnionist (%)\nNeither (%)\nNationalist (%)\nTotal (%)\nCount\n\n\n\n\n2000-2004\n0.8\n36.5\n62.7\n100.0\n3339\n\n\n2007-2008\n0.4\n46.9\n52.6\n100.0\n1242\n\n\nTotal\n0.7\n38.7\n60.6\n100.0\n4581\n\n\n\nChi-Square Tests\n\n\n\nTest\nValue\ndf\nAsymp.

There is a drop-off in Nationalist self-identification, falling from 62.7 per cent to 52.6. This is sizeable. However, it also highlights a surge in support for Nationalism between the Breen study and 2000. In 1989, Nationalist self-identification is at only 40 per cent, by 1994 it was 54, and between 2000 and 2004 it was at 62.7. Therefore, in spite of the rapid advance towards peace during late 80s and 90s, we see a polarizing in constitutional identity; one which, it is worth noting, is not consistent with the desire for a United Ireland, which between 1994 and 2004 fell by 5.6 per cent.  With the losses in Nationalist support supplementing the ‘neither’ category rather than the Unionist one it also appears to lag behind the flurry of ‘don’t knows’ of 2000-2004. Thus far it would seem there are a more complex set of motivations driving the Catholic sense of identity than was first anticipated.\nWith this in mind, Table 5, which shows support for particular parties, is potentially very enlightening. Most striking in the first instance is the near-total dominance in support for nationalist parties, with 94.1 per cent in 2000-2004 and 93.5 per cent in 2007-2008. This runs entirely contrary to Table 4; there is a 30-plus percentage point differential between self-identifying as nationalist and voting as nationalist. The expected increase in middle-ground politics based on Table 4 does not hold here, with the Alliance party receiving 4.3 and 5.1 per cent of support, in spite of 36.5 and 46.9 indicating they are neither Unionist nor Nationalist. In this sense, whatever people might feel, when it comes to voting they opt for the traditional choice. On the back of table 4, the almost-exclusive support for nationalist parties is bemusing. While on the surface supporting the null hypotheses that religion determines identity, in the context of the accumulation of findings we see the picture is extremely complex.\n\n\nTable 5: Catholics: Support for Unionist and Nationalist Parties and Alliance by Period (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nDUP (%)\nUUP (%)\nAlliance (%)\nSDLP (%)\nSinn Fein (%)\nTotal (%)\nCount\n\n\n\n\n2000-2004\n0.5\n1.1\n4.3\n65.0\n29.1\n100.0\n2371\n\n\n2007-2008\n0.7\n0.7\n5.1\n53.8\n39.7\n100.0\n1725\n\n\nTotal\n0.6\n1.0\n4.5\n62.3\n31.6\n100.0\n4096\n\n\n\nIn the period 1989-1994 SDLP was the primary nationalist political party, Sinn Fein being the more republican of the two parties. In Breen, 96 per cent of Sinn Fein voters suggest support for a United Ireland, as opposed to 76 per cent in the case of the SDLP. Maintaining for many years controversial ties to the IRA Sinn Fein was estranged from the peace process. Even up until 1994, the party was reluctant to participate in cross-community debate. After 1996, Sinn Fein became more established as a mainstream political party. By 2001 Sinn Fein and the SDLP were virtually neck and-neck but Sinn Fein had significantly greater momentum and by 2005 had outstripped the SDLP as the nationalist voting stronghold.1819 Table 5, however, implies overwhelming support for the SDLP, with 62.7 per cent of support between 2000 and 2004 and 53.8 per cent in 2007-08. This may explain the more moderate attitude towards devolution highlighted in Table 2. It also throws up concerns over how representative the sample is as well. Another possible explanation may be that, having conducted the interviews face-to-face, people were reluctant to express support for Sinn Fein, consider its more explicitly republican connotations.\nThe shifting in allegiances between 2000 and 2008 may be seen as representative of Sinn Fein’s growing recognition as a mainstream political party. That there is a shift in both the SDLP (decline) and Sinn Fein (increase) suggests that, under-representation notwithstanding, considering the separate analysis of the party’s support, there is a compelling trend at play. Therefore, what we have is both an indication of a shift in preference towards the more republican of the two parties, at the same time as increased willingness to accept a devolved government. And, perhaps, this is the crucial distinction; that of support for a devolved government rather than Home Rule: compromise is acceptable as long as people feel empowered by a sense of autonomy and by a vociferous figurehead. This is illustrated perfectly by then-contemporaneous events.\nThe power-sharing of 2006 saw a union between Northern Ireland’s two most polarized political parties, neither of whom had featured in Northern Ireland’s first assembly back in 1998, just after the Good Friday Agreement. Then, it was the more moderate UUP and SDLP who were chosen as representatives. Nine years later, the responsibility of finding compromise was entrusted to the DUP and Sinn Fein. Their acrimony was subjugated by the mutual desire for autonomy. Sinn Fein rejected roles in the shadow assembly, and formed an alliance with their local rivals because they would only participate in a devolved power-sharing government, irrespective, ultimately, of who they would be sharing power with.20\n\n\nTable 6: Catholics: Constitutional Identity by Party Preference (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nParty\nRemain part of UK (%)\nReunify Ireland (%)\nOther option (%)\nDon’t know (%)\nTotal (%)\nCount\n\n\n\n\n2000-2004\nSDLP\n20.9\n48.6\n13.7\n16.8\n100.0\n1930\n\n\n2007-2008\nSDLP\n54.0\n33.4\n8.7\n3.9\n100.0\n689\n\n\nTotal\nSDLP\n27.6\n45.5\n12.7\n14.2\n100.0\n2619\n\n\n2000-2004\nSinn Fein\n5.4\n80.1\n7.7\n6.8\n100.0\n977\n\n\n2007-2008\nSinn Fein\n20.5\n67.4\n10.8\n1.4\n100.0\n288\n\n\nTotal\nSinn Fein\n9.8\n76.4\n8.6\n5.2\n100.0\n1265\n\n\n\nChi-Square Tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParty\nTest\nValue\ndf\nAsymp.

Perhaps even it is a rebuttal of subservience under both direct rule and the union with Ireland, wherein local voices may resonate less strongly than in the cloistered environment of Northern Ireland. Regardless of whether people like to admit it, it may reflect some bizarre sense of Northern Irish patriotism, the recognition and entrenchment of polar identities within a workable framework, with just the right balance of autonomy and management. In a divided society with a degree of autonomy, it becomes important to achieve ‘critical mass’ in negotiating with the ‘other’ side for a ‘fair’ slice of the pie (that is, resource allocation decisions). Sinn Fein are the party that Catholics now view as the one to shout loudest for their share of the pie, just as Protestants seem to have decided on the DUP.\n\n\nTable 7: 2007-2008 Catholics: Preferred Long-Term Policy for NI by NS-SEC 5-Class Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\nDirect Rule (%)\nDevolution (%)\nReunify Ireland (%)\nTotal (%)\nCount\n\n\n\n\nManagerial & professional occupations\n2.4\n51.7\n45.9\n100.0\n403\n\n\nIntermediate\n9.3\n47.7\n43.0\n100.0\n430\n\n\nSmall employers & own account workers\n4.3\n39.1\n56.5\n100.0\n91\n\n\nLower supervisory & technical\n11.3\n38.7\n50.0\n100.0\n62\n\n\nSemi-routine & routine\n6.0\n36.5\n57.5\n100.0\n125\n\n\nTotal\n5.6\n42.8\n51.6\n100.0\n711\n\n\n\nChi-Square Tests\n\n\n\nTest\nValue\ndf\nAsymp.

Between the semi-routine worker and the managerial and professional occupations there is a differential of 11.6 per cent. This would appear to support the assertion that expressions of constitutional identity are influenced, at least to some degree by social class. Similarly, it is important to note that devolution is more heavily favoured by the top two strata. In fact, support for devolution can be seen to correlate entirely with social classification. I can only infer, then, that those at the top of the pile wish to see no change to their position and are, in the majority, content to see Union with Britain via devolution so long as they are succeeding.\nOne very interesting finding is the surprising degree of support for Direct Rule among those in Lower supervisory and technical occupations, with 11.3 per cent, as well as, to a lesser extent those in intermediate and routine positions. Owing to their greater expressions of support for a unified Ireland one would have assumed, perhaps, that religiosity was simply more entrenched among lower and middling class positions. However, what this suggests instead is that, while a Unified Ireland may best serve their interests, fundamentally, these groups are simply seeking a change in their circumstances and will take improvement wherever they can find it. Indeed, self-employed workers present an anomaly; perhaps explicable by their stronger desire for self-determination.\nAll in all, social class suggests that identity in Northern Ireland is dependent on more than merely religion. It is holistic and entails the evolution of a class-based interaction with religion which has been eroded and re-assessed in recent years. In Breen the repudiation of the union is significantly more unanimous and so, while my own findings align to an extent with his hypothesis that ‘strength of Nationalist feeling depends less on whether a Catholic is well-educated, middle class and so on and more on the degree to which he or she thinks that Catholics are discriminated in Northern Ireland’[22], there are numerous caveats."

    "text": "Conclusions\nI believe that within Table 7 lies some explanation for the curiosity that is a strengthening in extremist politics coinciding with a moderation in constitutional preferences. Social class highlights the fact that the new expressions of identity relate to satisfaction with the status quo and the extent to which people feel their needs are being met. Support for a united Ireland is far from universal; in his conclusion Breen shoots down the prospect of its enactment, arguing that it would take an adult Catholic population ‘two and a half times larger than the Protestant population’. It is perhaps indicative both of the social gains made by Catholics as well as the recognition of its implausibility that has ensured that expressions of identity are being re-directed to maximizing the stake in whatever semblance of autonomy can be grasped at. Devolution in Northern Ireland represents the bare minimum, but it is enough to establish a rarefied, insular environment in which interest groups can compete and thrive. This is the realization of Rose’s demonstration of Ulster as a separate entity, where identities which would go ignored in a larger setting are the drivers of change.\nI am inclined to reject the null hypotheses. Religiosity is subjugated, therefore, to a desire for advancement of particular social compositions rendered immovable by history. Catholics and Protestants defy religion; they are social and cultural identities to the extent that political parties are entrenched along religious grounds, with an in-between ignored by the voters because it obfuscates the advancement of your interests. This is the conclusion I have drawn from the inconsistencies noted between Tables 4 and Tables 5, which highlighted the discrepancy between constitutional identification and voting patterns. In the recognition of a need to negotiate with the other side it is uncertainty that drives people to the extremes. Sinn Fein, as the most vociferous of these on the Nationalist side, are charged then with the subliminal formation of a new identity; a more modern, realistic expression of nationalism, that of a new, Catholic unionism; safeguarding and consolidating the Catholic demographic. It an identity filtered through an innate recognition that cross-community exchange is essential, but manifests itself as a monument to the lack of trust engendered by years of conflict. This ensures that those of each side demand figures of especially explosive common identity to stand their ground for them; it is balance and advancement through peaceful hostilities. In the wake of World War I, Winston Churchill referred to the prospects of change in Northern Ireland with uncompromising pessimism:\nEvery institution in the world was strained. Great Empires have been overturned. The whole map of Europe has been changed… But as the deluge subsides and the waters fall short, we see the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone emerging once again. The integrity of their quarrel is one of the few institutions that has been unaltered in the cataclysm which has swept the world.[23]\nIn fact, with a shift in the Catholic proportion favouring a union there is a change. The extent to which this is a consequence of the change in wording cannot disguise the fact that there has been an evolution in the way in which priorities are expressed. New wording merely masks the development of this phenomenon. This shift certainly demands further exploration, more than my research had the resources to afford it, but I believe that, rooted within social class, a common ground is developing, with identities enforced more by socio-political necessity as a consequence of affiliation not merely to religion, but to a more powerful, holistic, deep-seated identity. This subject demands more immersive research and, given the unprecedented political changes, will certainly get it."

    "text": "Originally Published by the Brasov Visitor - I’m not sure that still exists anymore :(\nNever in doubt. The men’s 100 metres I mean. Usain Bolt was truly awesome. The race may have lasted only 5 minutes but I was so caught up in the phenomenon that my attendance at Silviu Ploieşteanu, home of the mighty FC Brasov was very much in doubt. I missed the first 30 minutes of the game and therefore was totally unaware that CS Pandurri were actually leading through a 4th minute goal by the time I arrived.\nMy Near Miss\nFour weeks before, I had arrived in Brasov with the goal of experiencing 90 minutes of Eastern Bloc action and writing about it. So I pleased to discover that that the first home game of the season would take place on my last Sunday in Romania at 6pm Apparently not, I realised at 5.55 on Saturday evening, x minutes after Bolt’s legendary run and 10 minutes after the actual kick-off.\nI was still getting over Usain Bolt’s awesome 9.69, slouched in Deane’s, pint in hand, mouth hanging open in awestruck amazement when an ad for tonight’s football came on screen. The Beijing Olympics had me all motivated to go for a run myself and I was all ready to do just that, from the clunky shoes to the rather revealing short shorts. Hardly going-out clothes. I looked like an idiot. Not ideal attire for an in-the-flesh machismo sporting spectacle.\nIn a panic over my potentially lost article and experience, I sprinted out of the bar, changed some money and boarded a taxi to Silviu Ploieşteanu.\nI wasn’t even sure if the gates would still be open. And, to be honest, I still don’t know if they were. Either way, I didn’t pay. I went up to a steward at a random gate, asked how I get in and then proceeded to act totally innocent and pathetic, like a lost puppy (wasn’t actually an act, that’s really how I felt). The stupid running outfit probably played its part too. I couldn’t look more like a dazed and confused foreign tourist who had turned up at the wrong venue if I tried. Oh no! You mean the Olympics aren’t being held in Brasov at the 12,000-capacity Silviu Ploieşteanu Stadium?!?! Presumably the steward took pity on me, because rather than pointing me to a ticket office or telling me to get lost, he stealthily ushered me through the gate. Initially, I wasn’t sure whether he got a kick out of it or if FC Brasov is just really desperate for supporters. Either way, try sneaking into Old Trafford and Malcolm Glazer would have the firing squad after you. Well, fining squad.\nOnce through the fence I got a pretty lacklustre security check; a pat-down and a little root through my bag. Strangely, as soon as they established I was English (well, English-speaking) they let me straight through. Apparently we aren’t dangerous. In this particular case they would be right since the closest thing I had to a weapon was a week-old orange.\nInside, I took up a seat as close to the police as possible for safety reasons, whilst simultaneously trying to look totally innocuous. I was still sweating a little bit over the lack of ticket. I had a similar experience on a bus a few weeks earlier, which resolved itself rather inauspiciously. I didn’t realise you had to have bus tickets before boarding buses. I assumed you bought them off the driver, like at home. My error cost a 45 lei fine. Rooted deep in my subconscious the memory of the 45 lei fine was now returning to haunt me.\nBargains, Brides But No T-shirts\nThe last live football game I attended was Hadjuk Split vs Napoli. Although a friendly, it seemed like the whole Croatian police force was in attendance. Hadjuk Split is home to one of the most notorious Ultra groups (the Torcida - youtube them), and the most fined, in Europe. But, to my very relieved surprise, there were no riots and no flares, although it(still talking about Split here???) did remind me of a barbecue to which everyone was invited.\nThat’s not to say Romanian supporters are relaxed. Every one around me was shouting and singing continuously. Even the Pandurii fans were impressive, all 12 of them. For some reason the Brasov fans were chanting ‘Dan Petrescu!’ in the direction of the Pandurii supporters. This confused me, what does the Agent Fox Mulder look-alike (and highly-regarded ex-Chelsea and Romania player) have to do with Pandurii? As far as I can tell, the Romanian legend played for neither side. Sounds like a bit of an X-File to me.\nIf I hadn’t been so keen to write about FC Brasov and made the effort to look into them I would never have known Brasov had a football team. In fact,there are two! Forex Braso play in the division below. Yet, even inside the stadium I really didn’t see many people wearing FC Brasov replica shirts. There were more Romania t-shirts than Brasov. From a marketing and merchandising perspective the club didn’t seem to be making much of an effort. Could it be that much of their fanbase simply can’t afford to spend so much on a shirt? Or maybe they can, but have been conditioned consider it pretty pointless. Or perhaps they used up their replica shirt allowance stocking up on Romania kits during their brief, but interesting, Euro 2008.\nWhat they did have was a guy pouring Sprite, Cola and Fanta into paper cups from big two-litre bottles for 2 lei. Apparently they were 250 ml servings (although I have no idea how he could be sure) which would make a stadium soft drink half as expensive as most of the places I have been to so far. Needless to say, there were no prawn sandwiches for sale.\nAll of a sudden, a pair of newlyweds entered the stadium, still in their wedding outfits. The stand was to become their wedding buffet, even if there were no mini chicken kievs here either. Sipping on sprite, dancing to Tom Boxer, watching football…it was definitely grassroots. The bride was even missing one of her shoes. Twenty minutes after this first sighting, another married couple strolled past. I couldn’t help but wonder if FC Brasov didn’t double up as a c hurch – religion as football. In Argentina, Boca Juniors have actually expanded into the coffin-design industry so it wouldn’t be unheard of. Sure enough, one Brasov banner read ‘I would die for you!’\nBut What About the Game?\nThe football couldn’t quite match up to the crowd, but it held its own. Five minutes after I arrived Robert Ilyes equalized with an exceptional floating free-kick. As the game progressed it became harder to believe Brasov were only just promoted to the Romanian Liga 1. Pandurii were absolutely hopeless, Brasov totally dominant, constantly threading balls through behind the opposition full-backs. Pandurii’s defensive armor was riddled with holes and it was just a matter of time before Brasov unleashed a second, fatal bullet. And so it was that another fantastic strike from the edge of the area effectively killed the game off in the 66th minute. Sabrin Sburlea, a talented 19 year-old attracting the attention of Ajax, was the man who dea;t the critical blow.\nFC Brasov are a pretty decent outfit; they were denied a draw at Steaua Bucharest, Romania’s best known team and 1986 European Champions, merely through a last-minute winner earlier in the season and they have now earned two victories from their first four contests. A decent return, and I expect that their mix of talented youth like Sburlea with the experience of players like Catalin Munteanu (formerly of Atletico Madrid) and Bogdan Stelea (91 caps for Romania) should ensure their survival.\nFrom Beijing to Buenos Aires to Brasov, the congregation remains (mostly) the same. It’s a small world and that is a good final impression to bring home with me to Belfast."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My conceptualization centres on community sports clubs as operators in the spread of social capital. Putnam’s Bowling Alone (1995) sparked these thoughts, linking the demise of team sports, in favour of individual ones,1 with declining social capital, manifested through decreased civic participation. Using a West Belfast athletics team, this study examines the extent to which sport clubs build social capital, and how it is achieved. The essay first establishes the theoretical context of social capital and introduces the particular complexities of the region, the sport and the club through a short history. Discussions of access, ethics and methodology precede a review of research findings with reference to the social capital indicators and outcomes established by the literature. Concluding with an assessment of the successes and limitations of the study and, correspondingly, those of a sports club’s contribution to social capital, it reveals the club has accumulated social capital but is limited by resources. However, these limitations magnify the achievements, its impact suggestive of the privileged position enjoyed by athletics clubs as distributors of social capital. The club is in a period of transition and, while the study would doubtless have benefited from a longitudinal approach there were nonetheless illuminating discoveries relating to the potency of social networks.\nRelevance of Literature, and Theoretical Development\nInspired by Putnam’s linkage of declining social capital and decreasing participation in sports teams2, this study pursues explanations as to why and how sports clubs serve as sources of social capital. A running club seemed perfectly placed to probe this topic. A stereotypically individual sport, any popularity in running clubs belies the mythology of ‘The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner’  and implies that people pursue companionship, perhaps convinced that they function better with it. Social capital derived from membership in a running club is perfectly suited to demonstrating what social capital is considered instrumental in achieving; that is, expanding the relevance of individuals. It ‘refocuses analysis from individual behaviour to a matrix of relations…’3, ultimately transplanting the micro of individual values and familial bonds into the macro of cross-community governance and legislative institutions in order to more successfully identify and achieve shared goals.4\nThe club I chose appeared uniquely ideal. A running club founded in West Belfast during the Troubles (a strongly Republican community5, during the 1970s and 80s, at war) and capable of surviving could present a compelling case for the profundity of social capital and this argument: sports clubs serve as vital sources of social capital which strengthen cohesion in communities and individuals gravitate towards such sources, particularly during periods of stress and community isolation, because they recognise their necessity.\nHaving begun with Putnam, I will outline the literature platform employed to crystallize research questions and better inform and justify my methodology. My first challenge was reaching a satisfactory definition of social capital; there was an element of personal interpretation since a single definition was elusive. In the ‘Report on Research into Evaluating Community-Based and Voluntary Activity in Northern Ireland’ and ‘The Well-Being of Nations: The Role of Human and Social Capital’ I encountered four; those of anthropology, sociology, economics and political sciences.67 I favoured the sociological definition that social capital is composed of ‘…features of social life – networks, norms, and trust - that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives… Social capital, in short, refers to social connections and the attendant norms.’8\nThree components of social capital were further explicated in the aforementioned sources, synthesised with ‘Social Capital, Collectivism-Individualism and Community Background in Northern Ireland’9, ‘Revitalizing Civil Society through Social Capital Formation in Faith Based-Organizations: research findings from Northern Ireland’10 and ‘Toolkit to Measure Added Value of Voluntary and Community Based Activity’11, to provide these summaries:\nBonding capital are networks present and institutionalized in one’s known community. Outcomes are ‘empowerment’, ‘infrastructure’ and ‘connectedness’.\nBridging capital are networks established with previously unknown communities. Outcomes are ‘engagement’, ‘accessibility’ and ‘innovation’.\nLinking capital is the degree to which networks have scaled hierarchy and resource channels. Outcomes are ‘resources’ and ‘influence’12.\nSegregation alone doesn’t engender trust and solidarity within a community. Northern Ireland is a society of ‘individual strangers’.13\nDespite being less explicitly social capital-related ‘Charity Begins at Home: How Socialization Experiences Influence Giving and Volunteering’14 developed perspectives on generational handover of social capital, educating the next generation in collectivist norms. ‘It’s All About Time: Volunteering in Northern Ireland’15 provided further relevant elaboration. Volunteering, which proved more central to my study than I had anticipated, was a common thread throughout the literature; indicative of conscientious civic responsibility it’s considered a preponderant indicator of social capital16 i.e. ‘the “bridging” work of voluntary and community organisations .’17\nDurlauf is sceptical; ‘In much of Bowling Alone social capital is defined functionally: when social groups exhibit’‘good behaviours,’’ social capital is present.’18 He highlights potentially negative implications of social capital, from which I extrapolated relevance to Northern Ireland, ‘Identification with one’s country, and the attendant loyalties it induces towards other citizens, can act to bridge different ethnic groups within a country while in the same way bonding citizens in a way that increases hostility to foreigners.’19 This theme is present in Social Capital, Collectivism-Individualism, which fears one interpretation of social capital enables consolidation of existing power groups, an issue that would harden community divides.20 Indeed, ‘defining what is ‘good’ social capital at a community level in Northern Ireland, for instance, could be problematic in the context of our ethnically divided society.’21 Social capital must be a progressive concept and today aid cross-community bridging and linking capital, the broad-based interests of the communities. All three sources assert that social capital indicators are guidelines. In Northern Ireland variables such as trust in governance need to be weighted against history.22 The literature convinced me that flexibility in any application of social capital is necessary.\nUseful from a comparative and methodological standpoint was ‘Social Positioning and the Construction of a Youth Sports Club’. The two authors spent a year studying a UK athletics club. The organizational contrasts between our respective clubs were stark but we both recognized the need for ethnographic methodologies, including participant observation, interviews, and ‘thick description’ fleshing out rigorous write-ups23. As an informative guideline, their research also established the following normative membership stereotypes:\nAthletes are either ‘Samplers’ (emphasis on non-competitive playing) or ‘Beginning Specializers’ (around 13 it is suggested that drivers of participation shift to competition).\nParents are Non-attenders, Spectators, Helpers or Committed Members.\nWhile quantitative analysis can provide supportive figures, the only way to explain and understand the ambiguous processes underlying the formation of social capital is to see the processes in action, locate their genesis, and trace their evolution while discerning the meanings ascribed24 by actors. Fundamental reliance on qualitative methods, therefore, underscores my research. It is stressed:\n‘The use of this scale needs to be fleshed out with other, more qualitative methods, such as the use of case studies and “thick descriptions,”and reference to macro-social indicators…’ 25\nMethods\nContext and Background\nGap AC has its roots in the Gap Leisure Centre in the Lower Falls, a deprived area of West Belfast.  Ciaran, former international bronze medallist, explained the club now identifies itself more with a Leisure Centre in the Upper Falls (less deprived, but the same political profile as Gap). The Upper and Lower Falls are bridged by two graveyards, home to numerous Republican martyrs, including the Hunger Strikers. The club relocated in the 1990s owing to anti-social behaviour threatening the youth team. Like every other club in Belfast, though, it trains at Mary Peters Track26, Northern Ireland’s athletics Mecca. Located in the more affluent South Belfast area, Mary Peters is a neutral space in Northern Ireland terms i.e. accessible to both communities.\nGap AC emerged from an amicable split with a pre-existing club – Trident - a club founded in the 1970s by teachers in a local Catholic secondary school in Upper Falls, who recruited colleagues and friends. Trident was limited in geographic scope but massively successful at short-term recruiting of a concentrated crop of talent. A tight-knit network was formed, but with no effort to recruit a second generation Trident lasted little more than a decade. During 1982-1983 Arthur decided to start a club in his own particular area i.e. Gap AC. Gap was healthy through the mid-80s, an enthusiastic and vigorous community presence, even going so far as to distribute a newsletter to local homes. From the 1990s to mid-2000s Gap survived largely through the efforts of one committed individual, Anthony.\nThe club was sustained in this period by associations established with local schools, notably an all-girls comprehensive in the Andersonstown area of West Belfast. Ciaran, a teenager in the 1990s, noted how turnouts at the outset were massive, a task planted exclusively on Anthony’s shoulders. It couldn’t last. Ciaran admits that, owing to a combination of ‘laziness and injuries’, even he, a future international medallist, drifted away. Describing this era, Ciaran echoes Stephen, another adult member: ‘Anthony is Gap’. But, exclusive reliance on this ‘committed volunteer’27 ensured that the club’s existence was by the end of the 90s, in Ciaran’s own words, ‘hanging by a piece of string’.\nThe club evidently has strong associations with the area. When the Belfast Marathon was recently re-routed to exclude West Belfast, Gap’s Stephen was the local track-man that newspapers turned to for comment. The athlete and coach claimed to speak for the local community when he expressed his disgust at the decision.\nTwo stories I heard were particularly powerful in illustrating the fractious, turbulent nature of both the period and the area that the club grew out of. Characteristically soft-spoken, Frank, parent of two of the children, who has since taken on a role as supervisor/trainer for the youngest kids, explained that, at 21, he was burning cars. Things changed when he took up boxing, and his new-found focus culminated in a spot at a major international games. He doesn’t run (‘I’ve had enough pain’) and began helping out once his kids joined.\nDeclan entered athletics at 21, when he found a girlfriend and wanted to build fitness and self-confidence. Until that point he considered his lifestyle best expressed through an anecdote wherein himself and friends antagonized the local squad cars that used to stake out the area by throwing rocks, culminating with him being shot in the forehead with a plastic bullet. Taking to athletics with vigour, he ran five miles in 24 minutes. He, too, has children in the club and helps out. West Belfast has a natural association with religion and republicanism. But maybe sport offered an alternative, more progressive form of civic participation.\nAccess\nMy participant observation commenced just before returning to Warwick for spring term. I knew Anthony from my running days28; then Gap consisted of 3 males and about 6 girls; Anthony was the only adult we saw. Nervously I looked up Anthony’s number and phoned. To account for nerves I wrote a script so that I could make it clear what I was looking for. While I mentioned social capital, I stressed to Anthony that I wanted to ‘tell the story of the club’. He sounded flattered, offering to arrange for 5 or 6 people to speak to me when I returned. He gave me his e-mail address and, shortly after, I followed up with an e-mail outlining my research goals which Anthony promised to distribute so that interviewees could prepare (Appendix A). As explained below, henceforth interviews were not scripted.\nData Collection\nI attended spring trainings and learned the club schedule. Training was on Tuesday evenings and Saturday mornings at the track. Thursday evenings the Leisure centre is the starting point for a run around the local area. There was no fixed racing pattern, with the exception of several prestigious events during the Cross-Country and Track seasons, both of which were winding down during the respective time-periods of my study.\nThe first Tuesday evening I noticed numbers had multiplied beyond recognition; there were 25-30 kids at the track, and four adult co-ordinators on hand. Anthony, spotting Stephen and Anne, quickly offered me the chance to arrange interviews. Stephen runs for Gap but creams off the best talent as a multi-affiliated coach.  Anne has been running with Gap from age twelve. She is now nineteen or twenty, and trains with Stephen’s group, having grown out of people to run with in Gap.\nWith no adults for company and keen to ensure that, down the line, I would be able to hold pace, I set off for my own run. The scale of my participation would have been limited by any inability to keep up. I have run on-off, and unstructured, for two years.  In the lead-up to my return to Belfast I had been running a little with Warwick Athletics and a friend to get in shape. I heard the best subjects have something to keep you engaged; that something was the motivation necessary to get back in racing shape again.\nSaturday morning interviews were arranged for 9.30 before 10am training. A youth meet was in progress on the track and I wandered awkwardly until 9.50 when I noticed Stephen surrounded by 3 or 4 young female athletes. He was amiable, explaining he had forgotten about our meeting. I found him intimidating, and thought he’d find me inconvenient but, having told him I was looking for an informal chat about his role, he was happy to talk. I knew what topics I wanted to cover. I wanted the conversation to be organic, with only subtle guidance. I scrawled short-hand notes. Part of my anxiety stemmed from my belief that Stephen had his own operation, was busy and didn’t want the bother. But he gave me his phone number and, as a bonus, he spotted Ciaran and introduced us. As a favour Ciaran and two other runners were supervising the track. We chatted over tea.\nThe summer phase of my study differed on account of developing a training partner in Alan. Owing to Alan’s unreliability, I often found myself with time to tag along on runs with Treebeard, who supervises the youth team. With July taking its toll on the turnout, he was free to accompany me. Long runs, often conducted at ‘conversational pace’, were ideal. However, I relied on memory for these encounters-maybe for an hour or two before I had an opportunity to write them up. Recording devices would have felt obtrusive, formal and inappropriate. As a result field-notes and journal merged. The Mary Peters track was a blessing, offering opportunities to chat to runners during warm-ups, warm-downs etc, the whole Northern Irish track world situated within 400m.\nThis phase also placed greater emphasis on participant observation - informal interactions rather than scheduled sit-downs. I found that often people would start talking about fascinating, totally relevant details, relaying the story of the club without any prompting, making me feel guilty, compelling me to say, ‘This is so fascinating. Has Anthony told you about this sociology project I am doing? This would be really useful information’. And Anthony had. But I tried not to take informed consent for granted. On another occasion, David ran past me during a workout and said ‘Anthony told me about that project you are working on. Get my number off him and we can talk about it’. Others, like Alan, would talk at length about anything and everything, and could occasionally be re-directed to more relevant topics. My natural interest in the glory years permeated discussions with the older members, encouraging nostalgic story-telling.\nThrough these personal narratives, I established a club narrative, supplemented with web research - surprisingly fertile ground, including: blogs, results, news articles and sites for administrative bodies. Gap’s absence from official listing coupled with the informal nature of the networks displayed proved the participant observation more valid.\nBy summer I realised that the important people were those who maintained active ties with the club and with the sport; if they didn’t show up, they were of limited interest. I knew there to be tangential members with a strong connection to Gap who rarely appeared. These tangential members are an expansion of the roles explored by the Social Positioning study. It refers to members who maintain ties with the club and intersect at key moments. Many had their own schedules to keep, with participation confined to wearing the Gap vest on the rare occasions they competed. One such occasion was the marathon relay, the week after I returned to Warwick. During the course of my study Peter left, at his wife’s behest. The only concrete, ever-present component of the club was thus the youth team. Although my focus was on the motivations of the senior club members, I gained an appreciation that, these days, everything was an offshoot of youth membership.\nAnalysis\nAhead of the write-up I collated my journal entries into a narrative, which I colour-coded to develop conceptual threads that could be assessed in tandem with my thematically arranged literature reviews. This method was similar to that employed in the Youth Sports Club study:\n‘…labels were attached to the segments and all text segments that related to a specific category or theme were sorted accordingly. Similar to the constant comparative method of generating grounded theory…the data were reviewed repeatedly and continually coded, and similarities and differences, groupings, patterns and items of particular significance were sought…’29\nReflections\nConcerns identified:\nDelays in writing up material caused by inability to write while running may have compromised accuracy of accounts.\nProximity to gatekeeper may have enabled preconceptions.\nAthletics background may have enabled preconceptions.\nOral narratives may introduce bias and/or selective memory.\nRole of gatekeeper in defining club may have skewed emphasis on youth aspect.\nRisk Management:\nSought permission, outlined purpose of research. Achieved informed consent.\nClarification was pursued when uncertain about accuracy.\nEfforts to ensure anonymity, includes use of pseudonyms.\nWithheld interpretations that could not be satisfactorily vetted within time-frame.\nDid not interview youth members.\nResearch Findings\nBonding, Bridging and Linking\nReligion and politics may be a driving force of the past; only twice did members mention religion. On both occasions the topic was dismissed by the group, and suggestions of extremism ridiculed. Segregation and subsequent geographic isolation likely influenced earliest club uptake, exclusively centred on West Belfast  and emerging from a Catholic school. Religion was therefore indirectly influential. Rebuttal of significance of religion suggests innovation and progressive group understanding of bridging precepts. ‘Bad’ social capital is rightly being eroded. Stephen has a strong affiliation with another local club who are noted for their inclusive, progressive attitude. There were no rivalries on religious grounds. No club was even identified in such terms. Indeed, athletes compete in both the Northern Irish and the Irish Championships. Political participation is crucial to Putnam’s conception of social capital outcomes30, but politics was mentioned only once, a cynical reference to backhanders financing a bridge in rural Donegal.\nGap developed because a local runner, well-established within his network, wanted a club situated within his own community. Ciaran generally competed for Ireland, but competed for Northern Ireland at certain meets. Yet, when talking of his international bronze he always referred to having won it as a Gap athlete. Identity was therefore found to ally more definitively with community rather than religious or political affiliation. Moreover, the construction of non-linear, flexible identities is indicative of club facilitation of bridging capital.\nThe success of previous incarnations ensured the club left an imprint across Ireland and beyond. Races are scattered throughout the country, and even on a continental level. Gap’s presence therefore transcended immediate community and introduced bridging capital. One athlete that Treebeard mentioned was a multiple-winner of the Marrakesh Marathon. Stephen is coaching an international games contender.\nGap has moved almost exclusively and pro-actively in the direction of youth recruitment. Affiliation with local schools was the first stage in this, and continues to be the primary source of accessibility. New membership arrived and multiplied from Southside Grammar School. Among these members, a mother who is a local primary school teacher has contributed heavily to youth teams by promoting Gap. Treebeard, who joined along with three of his children, shared the load and re-energized the project. At the same time, allegiance with local all-girls comprehensive was revived, in part due to Anne.\nParticipation in the athletics network has, for some, been empowering. Having joined through the supervisor of his apprenticeship, Stephen has increasingly treated athletics as a full-time job. Ciaran is a physiotherapist and personal trainer with strong ties to the sports institute and a client list formed primarily from contacts made over the course of his athletics career. When Alan developed an injury he went to Ciaran for physiotherapy, who seemed to provide the service for free, or at least a token fee. Networks have leveraged resources and skill sets across the generations, feeding back into the present club. Similarly, Anne has gone on to university to study sports sciences, as is the case with many of the top local athletes, some of whom have been able to obtain performance-related scholarships to the UK and America. More subtly, affiliated schools highlight epicentre expansion and socio-economic bridging, cracking into prosperous South Belfast. Some older members have also relocated, all the way to Donegal in two instances. Treebeard and David provided accommodation in their Donegal holiday homes. A joint project was proposed. The club is accumulating resources.\nAnthony, recently retired, worked for the local council. A source of linking capital, his contacts lever use of a mini-van for travel. Very few people in West Belfast went to university in Anthony’s era, but he put himself through night classes and ascended the ladder, working for the council for his entire career. All the other adults who mentioned occupation were tradesmen. Treebeard’s plumbers’ van was also used for transport. Alan, in contrast, having just become self-employed, experienced difficulties finding work. On one occasion, however, he received employment from someone familiar to Paul and himself through running.\nNorthern Ireland doesn’t have a big-enough running scene to ensure top runners have people at their level to train with. Consequently, devolved groups have developed, such as that fronted by Stephen. Ciaran explained that he was always a Gap athlete, but the best athletes have to train together, irrespective of club allegiances and networking always has, and likely always will, work this way. When his sprinting potential was realized, Anthony relayed him to the more sprint-specific coach of another team, while still competing for Gap.\nMary Peter’s track therefore has a decisive sphere of influence. Due to this centralization Mary Peter’s increases scale of networks and bonding capital. This was in evidence when Ciaran and two other non-Gap athletes voluntarily supervised the track. Moreover the track is microcosmic, with role definition and diversity emerging to increase access to resources. One day, Treebeard had a nasty reaction to a bee sting. Fortunately, the club knew two doctors who were at the track and provided medical counsel.\nCompetition and the Pursuit of Collectivism: Belying ‘Individual Strangers’\nBeginning with the Marathon relay I noticed a desire among the membership to construct teams. There was a gravitational pull; teams attract even the strays. In the run-up to the Donegal race, discussion revolved around the opportunity to enter teams and whether Gap had the numbers. Earlier Alan had asked me if I had any interest in running a 10k relay as his team-mate31. On another occasion, Alan attempted to race in secret because he wasn’t in shape. The secret was blown when he wore the free t-shirt from his race at the next training session. He didn’t even run that day; he just came for the company. Often, efforts were made to co-ordinate workouts as team by exchanging pace-making duties and streaming abilities.\nIn contrast, Treebeard, whose name derives from a youth spent running cross-country, talked about the intensity of his old training groups. Their workouts were designed by the coach to ensure that running through the pain barrier was something you took for granted week-in week-out. Each weekend you raced. Hard. Alan had discussed Treebeard’s old times with awe, including his 30-minute-flat 10k. Darren didn’t even think it was possible for a human to break 30 and was incredulous when I told him the world record was 26. It suggested that running needn’t be an all-consuming obsession, he evidently didn’t follow it closely or gauge performance benchmarks; it was just something to get you out of the house. And better do that with a team than by yourself.\nGap raced once during the course of my study and it was more a weekend break than competition, to the extent that it coincided with a local festival. So much pre-departure discussion focussed on the prospect of fairgrounds. Tellingly, for this Donegal race, Darren elected to run with the seniors rather than an under-age category where he probably would have won a prize. Participation trumped competition.\nAnthony’s last competitive race was approximately 20 years ago. A group of senior males who were short a member asked him to fill out their relay team for the 4*400. Clearly, Anthony’s persistence with the club stems not from competitiveness.\nBureaucratic Presence, Informal Social Networks Mediate Micro and Macro\nGap is not like most clubs; it has no website, is not listed on the Athletics Northern Ireland website of certified clubs, and doesn’t collect membership fees. It raises funds through bag-packs at local supermarkets, social events and voluntary contributions. Despite not being certified, putting Gap AC down on a race-entry form or track membership entitles you to a discounted rate. Gap survives on name-recognition, social networks accumulated in the past and obstinate member loyalty, irrespective of their present-day involvement. Despite lack of certification, the local marathon appointed one club-member a pace-maker, with his club affiliation billed a qualification. But exclusively social networks are limited and temporal; modernisation and formalisation is necessary. The club issued consent forms for parents to sign before the trip and I also heard discussions about insurance and registration.\nTrust\nTrust is central to any conception of social capital32. The potency with which athlete-coach relationships can develop is evidenced by the story of one former athlete. Tim had no-one of his ability or dedication to train with. Another Gap athlete, Patrick, an amateur sports masseuse and coach of two fairly high-calibre senior females (one of whom runs for Gap) occasionally coached the youth squad. Tim took to him with reverent, unflinching loyalty, principally because Patrick liked more demanding training sessions. Looking for people to run with, Tim and Anthony contacted St. Leopold’s, a powerhouse athletics club derived from the eponymous boys Catholic grammar and situated in inner-city North Belfast. Tim was assured that he could run with them and was guaranteed a spot on their tour to America. But he had to entrust all coaching responsibility to St. Leopold’s. Unwilling to leave Patrick, the arrangement fell through.\nNormalizing Social Responsibility\nMore than most clubs, and owing to its lack of bureaucratic infrastructure, Gap relies on trust. It is intrinsically linked to the consistent fulfilment of attendant norms in social responsibility. That club values have for so long been defined almost entirely by one person ensures that, in this case, they are more crystallized than might otherwise be the case.\nThe extent to which normalized club values are entrenched was pivotal in a recent schism arising over a young athlete’s future recounted by Treebeard. One young member demonstrated potential in primary school meets and her family pursued more intense sessions through Patrick. Cautious about over-training, Anthony was insistent that she was doing too much, too soon. Breakaway AC was formed. Having since fallen off the radar, partly due to injuries, they are occasionally referenced, generally with a mischievous tone. Vindicated, Gap’s reflections are nonetheless bitter-sweet. Through competitiveness, Breakaway pursued a single-objective approach rather than the philosophy of all-embracing participation adopted by Gap. The former proved difficult to maintain. The latter helps explain Gap’s survival.\nA further example of cohesive club values; the adult members agreed with immediate unanimity to supplement their entry fees with a club donation towards the Donegal race organizers.\nDiversity\nGirls have always outnumbered boys because, according to Ciaran, boys are lured away by Gaelic Games and football. Girls don’t have such stereotypical niches. However, the original school being all-male, the demographic make-up of the adult team remains overwhelmingly male. Anthony’s ties with local girls’ school have been augmented by more recent associations with mixed-gender schools. However, the trend of female participation is not reflected among the supervisors, all of whom are male. So, on the away trip, one female parent accompanied the group. Diversity among authority is identified as a feature of social capital. Its neglect owes much I suspect to generational discrepancies and societal stereotypes. Lack of female coaching was a feature of the track generally. However, the club has increased accessibility and empowerment by enlisting older youth-team members in coaching programmes. Longer-term, the club seems set for proportional representation.\nGenerational Discrepancies\nThe youth club is the only one with tangible infrastructure and is easy to join; it would be very difficult for a senior individual to join without prior involvement. If you only attended training sessions it would be easy to assume there was no senior team. On one occasion, I trained with David. Joining along with his son, the onus was on him to find training partners. This was easier through club networks but when I ran with his training group it was a mish-mash of ages, genders, abilities and club affiliations. The group was centred around David, the other athletes being predominantly personal networks. I didn’t talk much to them, and the majority neither lingered nor were especially well-known to Anthony, Treebeard or any of the Gap supervisors present.\nSocial aspects were evidently instrumental in attracting membership from the outset. Stephen cited it as his primary reason for participation, while Treebeard fondly recalled that they were ‘a crowd of drunks’ post-race. At the Donegal prize-giving Treebeard, David and myself did indeed visit a bar, with Treebeard buying a round and refusing to take my money. We talked to the winner who was promoting an upcoming race. Treebeard had mentioned how last year he had been delegated supervisor while the other adults went to a pub. This year the social lives of adult and youth membership converged.\nEveryone had brought multiple outfits, and post-race got kitted out for a night on the town. The night was largely spent eating sweets, toasties and speculating on burgeoning romances between young athletes. The club is defined by the youth team so completely that adult membership, serving principally as volunteers, is merely a byproduct of it. The club also organises exclusively social events for youth members e.g. activity days. I learned that the club enjoyed another trip to Donegal shortly after. These reinforce connectedness.\nThe Future\nTreebeard said he vowed at the outset to commit to five years of volunteering with the club and has recognized the club’s need to retain athletes within the setup and within the sport through the late-teens, the make-or-break age when participation is most precarious. He is anxious to develop stable training groups that would ensure athletes at this stage had something for them beyond adolescence. Having established himself as an equally-active partner to Anthony (who he described as being ‘set in his ways’) and being responsible for much of the club’s re-invigoration I questioned whether Treebeard would be able to step back, and where it would leave the club if he did.\nConclusions\nThese past two decades cannot provide any real gauge on what the club’s future holds; Gap’s progress has been limited by only having one pro-active steward. Now that there are several hands-on volunteers, exponential growth would be expected. Further, persistence and the loyalties demonstrated towards a club so lacking in infrastructure were striking. Especially considering that participation in sport is limited by age and physical capacity. So, the extent to which members have remained involved over such long, tumultuous periods illustrate that, though limited in resources, the club is succeeding in its primary objectives.\nIronically, this sports club’s participation in social capital has been facilitated by the club’s lack of competitiveness and a focus on social aspects. Being less formal and regimented demonstrates its desire to focus on strengthening aspects of participants’ social experiences through the medium of sport. The key to consolidation has been identified as friendship. Competition can be a barrier to participation - prospective members may feel intimidated or inadequate, and the time commitment in highly competitive clubs is intense. Exclusively competitive racing demonstrates strain on both parent and child. Dropping a sport is easy, but dropping friends is harder. In this way, my findings are more nuanced than those of the Social Positioning study. The study demonstrates that hard-and-fast labelling of membership adopted by the Social Positioning study may demand a re-assessment33. Given more time I would like to have investigated channels of consent to pursue a youth-based study oriented around dissecting ‘samplers’ and ‘specializers’ to substantiate the observed group dynamic.\nPerhaps as a consequence formal, bureaucratic aspects have been neglected, over-ridden by an accumulation of trust and goodwill. These are temporal, and increasingly being subjugated by legislative necessities. I doubt I could have achieved the access I did in more formal associations. The club’s linking capital remains precarious, unconsolidated, but recent progress has sought to redress these concerns; heart-screening for athletes, coaching badges, first aid courses, pursuit of funding. The bonds of membership for the new generation of supervisors are strong, built on family. If, as Bekkers suggested, volunteering parents do embed civic participation in their children then the long-term future of the club should be stable.34 But, there are question marks over how long Anthony (now retired) and Treebeard, the club’s frontrunners, will stay active. Consequently, this study would have benefited from a more longitudinal approach, most pertinently to examine how a club evolves into a formal structure and consolidates a resource base that truly facilitates self-determination and establishes itself within a macro infrastructure. Moreover, for a more rounded picture, I would have liked to observe the club during racing season.\nBut, what the study has demonstrated is that sports clubs are far from individualistic and, perhaps more importantly, even a sports club with such limited resource capital can nonetheless succeed in introducing participants to immersive social networks. Irrespective of scale they have the capacity to produce profound, enduring impacts. The centrality of Mary Peter’s Track is one reason why, I suspect, athletics clubs in Northern Ireland have shirked religious affiliations35 and why, whatever, the community background, the sport can serve as a cultural melting pot.36 The original Gap had the social capital to span the entirety of West Belfast. In a fresh context, from a fresh start, and with more fluid community boundaries 37 it now has the platform to bridge indiscriminate social networks across a much wider area.\nBibliography\nBacon, Derek, ‘Revitalizing Civil Society through Social Capital Formation in Faith Based-Organizations: research findings from Northern Ireland’, Fifth Conference of the International Society for Third Sector Research, July 2002, Cape Town.\nBekkers, René, ‘Charity begins at home How socialization experiences influence giving and volunteering’, 34th Arnova Annual Conference, 17th-20th November 2005, Washington DC\nCairns, E., van Til, J., and Williamson, A., (2003) Social Capital, Collectivism-Individualism and Community Background in Northern Ireland.  A report to the Office of the Deputy First Minister and the Head of the Voluntary and Community Unit of the Department for Social Development.  Consulted at: http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/socialcapital.pdf\nDepartment for Social Development, (2006) Toolkit to Measure the Added-Value of Voluntary and Community-Based Activity.  Consulted at: http://www.dsdni.gov.uk/index/voluntary_and_community/vc-publications/vc-guidance.htm.\nDurlauf, Stephen N., (2000) Bowling Alone: A Review Essay, Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organization, p.3.

    "text": "Innovations\n\nSouth Africa\nThe South African TRC was structurally unique in two significant ways. Unlike most Truth Commissions, South Africa’s model development was expressly democratic; the process was informed by those affected but pre-empted accusations of impartiality by acknowledging ANC culpability in human rights violations, subjecting themselves to the same procedures as pro-apartheid perpetrators. Representatives of the independent commission were publically-nominated and the process, endorsed by Parliamentary Act, emphasised transparency. Hearings were public. Secondly, determination to provide legal accountability, against the ‘crass impunity’ and ‘partial justice’ which affected victim support for the blanket-amnesty Chilean and Argentinean commissions, resulted in conditionality of amnesty33: ‘judicial stick and TRC carrot’34. Amnesty was individualised; perpetrators of gross violations were invited to apply within a 16-month window, exchanging full disclosure for criminal and civil court reprieve dependent on the qualifying criteria of political motivation. Personal motives were ineligible. This time-window forced the hand of prospective applicants; 7,116 applied, among whom 1,973 received a hearing and were confronted by their victims before the Commission. 1,167 amnesties were granted35.\nWhile recognizing its imposed limitations, the TRC’s Final Report supports restorative justice in explicit contrast to retribution, expressing the former’s superior facilitation of authoritative, inclusive truths. These extinguish lingering debate and restore the dignity of victims by officially acknowledging their ‘unknown narratives of apartheid’36. Kiss highlights the superiority of truths obtained through commission over trial, citing General Malan’s expansive TRC admissions relative to his earlier criminal trial, and potential chain-of-command accountability. For Kiss, ‘more dangerous, perhaps, than ignored injustices are distortions and disinformation’37. Crucially, the TRC could erode pre-existing stereotypes which, uninterrupted, would sustain social fractures. This was achieved through four categorizations of truth, balancing legalistic objectivity with more contextual, participatory and personal forms, towards reconciling ‘an acceptable truth…made and owned by the people.’38 Desmond Tutu’s reflections on contextualizing and understanding violence39 through new forms of truth are supported by Baumann’s assertion that divided societies must acknowledge the moral legitimacy of the ‘other’s’ violence in order to break from the past and fully address the dehumanizing effects of past injustices40. As evidenced by the Final Report’s exhaustive recommendations, the TRC’s accountability sought to explain culpability within broader frameworks of applicability and appease victim demands for justice through social transformation41.\nHayner argues that Truth Commissions attained popularity because of their superior ability to develop truth, peaceful reconciliation and human rights culture42. However, concrete linkages to justice had to be established. South Africa publicized perpetrators to an unprecedented degree, as well as investigating institutional accountability. Truth is an essential starting-point; it accurately distinguishes innocence from guilt, further combatting distrust by ‘breaking cycles of violence and oppression that characterize profoundly unjust societies.’43 Cognisant, however, of displaced criminal justice, a crucial component was the Reparation and Rehab Committee, which assisted social justice, healing and reconciliation through reparatory grants.[44] Efficacy and victim support are therefore contingent on fulfilling legal measures, reparations, and developmental reforms.\n\n\nRwanda\nIn the immediate aftermath of the genocide, the ICTR established jurisdiction over ‘high-level genocidaires’44 who committed crimes in 1994. Scorned by the national government (RPF) it has thusfar concluded 52 trials45. Nationally, Rwanda’s 1996 genocide law rejected earlier consideration of South Africa’s model, feeling reconciliation should wait for justice46. Retributive justice is considered instrumental in deterring future violence and fostering respect for human rights and rule of law. Catharsis derives from appeasing  victims’ desires for, and legal rights to, criminal justice47. Efforts towards indicting all 100,000 detainees (750,000 were eventually charged48) incarcerated for suspected association with the genocide4950 were undermined by resource limitations and a judiciary devastated by death and exile. By 2001 5,300 trials were concluded; prison overcrowding and resource drains prefaced the introduction of the recently-concluded gacaca courts for non-capital crimes ranging from looting to murder. Early optimism51 was predicated on (and, in some cases52, sustained by) four core features.\nFirstly, Tim Clark supports its efficiency in ‘delivering accountability for hundreds of thousands of génocidaires and acquitting tens of thousands of falsely accused suspects’53. Secondly, post-genocide Rwanda suffered mutual fear; the Tutsi minority feared democracy camouflaged genocide planning, while the Hutu majority feared justice pursued impartial vengeance (not helped by retaliatory killings) and consolidation of Tutsi power54. Gacaca courts thus suggested necessary awareness of truth and reconciliation55, embedding ‘strong restorative elements’ within a retributive framework. Gacaca was modelled on a traditional, pre-colonial system of informal community justice emphasizing public restoration and reparation. Rwanda’s state-sanctioned narrative concludes that ethnic fractures were a colonial ‘invention’56. A pre-colonial justice model elicits broader appeal than positivistic judicial structures57 disproportionately populated by the Tutsi through Hutu dispersal and perceived as colonial implants. As Kiss demonstrated with reference to TRC discourses of ‘forgiveness’ and ‘ubuntu’58, here Betts suggests that expiation and reconciliation relies on ritualistic and culturally-specific dimensions59. Gacaca constituted a symbolic reconciliatory platform stressing collective commonalities.\nThirdly, mass-participatory crimes necessitate mass-participatory reconciliation. To ‘fulfil the normative criteria of stability and social integration, it justice must be reoriented towards the community level’60. In October 2001, 254,000 ‘honourable’, lay locals were elected to oversee trials. Defendants were denied professional legal representation but could call witnesses; no formal evidence was required. Perpetrators were tried before the community where their alleged crimes were committed and, serving as witnesses and jurors, community attendance was compulsory. Empowered to deliver life sentences, perpetrators providing full confessions, apologies and implicating accomplices could nevertheless halve their sentences through outright reductions and community work61. As an open forum, the process contributes theoretically to ‘political and personal reconciliation…people are given the opportunity to confront their attackers, tell their stories and express pent-up emotions all in a secure environment.’62 Similar to Kenya’s customary law, Gacaca was legitimized through a privileged re-invention of tradition which differed markedly in its contemporary form; ‘highly regulated, national and involuntary’63, and ‘distinctly punitive’64. Indeed, limitations and superficialities have re-constituted social fractures threatening progress towards peace and stability in Rwanda and South Africa."

    "text": "Critiques\n\nJustice\nA common theme in transitional justice is subversion of due process65. All nationally-administered models (Hungary excepted) adapted existing rules of law to accommodate transitional prerogatives66. Some South African victims filed a lawsuit asserting their ‘rights to seek judicial redress had been unconstitutionally violated’67. Victim support waned with TRC considered legally empty. Political will shifted towards the emergent problem of ‘disaffected black youth’68: ex-combatants and children deprived of social and educational opportunities. Suppressed by security and judicial structures akin to pre-apartheid incarnations, legalistic inadequacies failed to institute new norms of ‘human rights thinking’69. Van der Merwe’s suggestion that victims’ views were misrepresented, and their rights compromised, in formulating post-apartheid justice mechanisms70 further explains the discrediting of South African justice.\nDefending gacaca from human rights critiques, Clark criticises ‘legal rigidity’71; fulfilling Rwanda’s retributive ambition, gacaca was a necessary innovation, he argues. However, its judicial powers should have acknowledged intrinsic limitations. Upholding life sentences when denying suspects legal representation and where standards of evidence are not exacting, is illegal, unjust, and fails to distinguish the present state as rights-conscious. Often, confessions were dismissed and life sentences applied72 based on subjective facts open to manipulation; instances of ‘disappearance, murder, bribery and intimidation’73 quickly surfaced. Further, judges were not competent to accurately assess complex legal cases. Conseillers juridiques assisted the lay judiciary but, owing to Tutsi monopoly, would institute ethnically-bounded understandings74. President Kagame himself acknowledges that every Rwandan was in some form affected by the genocide75. Their impartiality is therefore contingent on stringent legal norms. Yet the ‘honour’ of judges was monitored by the state76 and outcomes hereby normalized according to officially-promulgated narratives. The inadequacy of evidence reflects an attitude that ‘we don’t need truth, we know who did what’77. This linkage between victor’s truth and justice alerts us to Foucault’s regimes of truth, where states regulate the parameters of admissible truth78.\n\n\nTruth\nSouth Africa’s TRC has not succeeded in delivering authoritative truth. Underrepresentation of female and illiterate ‘truths’ reflects exclusion; indeed, the mandate, limited to gross physical rights violations, excluded structural violence79, and fixated on political motive80. Further, between 1990 and 1994 the Commission documents 5,695 murders but authorities estimate 14,00081. Victims were not always forthcoming and time constraints increasingly limited the rigour of hearings82.  As in Rwanda, some found the truth and reconciliation process traumatic rather than cathartic. Significantly, in both cases, ‘tactical storytelling’83 distorted the testimony of victim and perpetrator around plea-bargaining and reparation claims, leading to false guilt or limited testimony. Powerful groups, organizations and ethnic cliques collectively negotiated or colluded in formulating acceptable truths8485. Individualized applications could be framed as aberrations, thereby limiting structural accountability and limiting wider, public acknowledgement of ‘little perpetrator’ guilt. TRC credibility was undermined by Desmond Tutu’s support for Winnie Mandela’s incomplete truth (the ANC was similarly well-served by amnesty), contributing to Afrikaner perceptions that they were subject to a ‘witch-hunt.’86\nNevertheless, in stark contrast to the ANC, the incumbent RPF have refused to acknowledge any accountability for a ‘large number of persons, including women and children, reported to have been killed from 1994 onwards.’87 Despite exhortation by the UN Human Rights Committee to investigate, Kagame, himself evading two international arrest warrants, including suspected Hutu genocide in DR Congo’88, dismisses violations as individual transgressions addressed by internal procedures89. Exclusionary truths objectively perpetuate ethnic divides through ‘victim’/‘perpetrator’ rigidity but ‘any attempts to hold an ethnic group (in this case, Hutus) collectively responsible for all crimes will only lead to future acts of collective retaliatory violence’. The exclusionary RPF narrative regulates global, national and local justice implementations through which it is reciprocally legitimized and reinforced. This narrative is embedded at ingando solidarity education camps compulsory for students, genocide perpetrators and ex-combatants90. These enforce contestable causal relationships between colonists and stratification, and a genocide narrative which prevents Hutu victims from demanding universal justice alongside legislation denying political rivals access to elections under flimsy accusations of ‘genocide ideology’. Internationally, ‘genocide credit’ acquired through inaction guilt facilitates unconditional development loans and exclusion of RPF crimes in the ICTR91.\n\n\nRemainders\nSecure, open, and emic Chakravarti argues gacaca demonstrated unique potential for simultaneously embedding agonistic contestation and participatory reconciliation through mutual ‘understanding’ of the violence of ‘other’ and the divisiveness of ethnic categorizations. Hutu narratives emphasize engagement in civil war and their perceived subjugation by Tutsi pre-dating the colonial period. A mutual recognition of legitimate claims to ‘victim’, both through Hutu and RPF crimes, could assist reconciliation. However, judicial exclusion is upheld social-economically through forced relocations: ‘Rwanda’s history should have shown that an ethnicization of economic activities is something to be avoided if the country wants to evolve to a more peaceful future.’92 Recent developmental integration has not addressed imbalances. Rather, ‘stable’ depictions conceal a worsening in conditions for genocide survivors and the rural poor, retaining ‘the conditions of structural violence’93. South Africa’s ambitious yet flawed truths demonstrated reconciliatory value in eroding stereotypes. Former TRC member Yasmin Sooka, however, stresses the new inequalities and impunities which remained.94 Failure to provide proposed reparation payments dovetails with the immediate amnesty of perpetrators in sentiments of ‘double victimisation’95.\nBonnie Honig argues temporary political stability is secured through exclusionary structures which formulate legacies of unaddressed grievance, remainders. These mutate in conflict with the institutions of exclusion96.Warren Christopher, reducing Bosnia to ‘nothing but a matter of ancient hatred’,97 overlooks the fact that ‘ancient hatreds’ are sustained by analogistic retreats towards bounded historical narratives and divisive socio-economic connotations98. Their cyclical re-constitution could be addressed through agonistic models of individualized narrative to nuance ‘out-group’ understandings alongside developmental reform to erode rigid socio-economic generalisations. These reconciliatory mechanisms have been neglected in Rwanda and South Africa’s justice models. Consequently, remainders will mutate from the re-constitution of exclusionary institutions of truth and justice to undermine efforts towards peace and stability."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOf transitional democracies, only Spain adopted a ‘pact of forgetting’99. ‘Collective amnesia’ has re-emerged in acrimony and disunity, leading Baumann to conclude every society has to deal with its past.100 Legitimate victim claims for justice must be appeased through impartial, uncensored truths. These can erode conflict identities and promote trust through understanding. Perpetrators should be addressed according to individual violations, in tandem with wider social justice. South Africa made early strides towards narrative reconciliation, yet cycles of physical and structural violence must be halted by efficiently addressing the past, learning from it and enacting appropriate long-term reform; the building-blocks of reconciliation and stable peace. By inadequately doing so, both examples have re-constituted and re-embedded legacies of exclusion, their efforts undermined by political will and resource capacity. However, the examples provoke innovative conceptualizations of mechanisms bridging restorative and retributive justice. Engagement with the past must recognize contextual limitations and cultural specificities, developing reconciliation through community participation and developmental integration (social justice) while maintaining criminal justice through pragmatically-scaled ‘fair trials’. These represent the supposed contribution of the international community. Despite costing over US$1 billion they have not contributed positively to post-genocide Rwanda101. Too distant from the population to promote trust and reconciliation, international efforts are best directed towards capacity-building in affected societies; upholding accountability and deterrence by facilitating and monitoring impartial developmental and judicial structures effected at national and local level.102103"

On 10 occasions, teams managed to increase their average attendance following relegation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelegated Team (Season)\nAttd.\nYear After\nAttd. year after\nLoss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nSunderland (96/97)\n20,865\n1997-98\n33,492\n60.5%\n\n\nLeicester City (01/02)\n19,835\n2002-03\n29,231\n47.4%\n\n\nNottingham Forest (92/93)\n21,910\n1993-94\n23,051\n5.2%\n\n\nIpswich Town (01/02)\n24,426\n2002-03\n25,455\n4.2%\n\n\nBurnley (21/22)\n19,399\n2022-23\n19,953\n2.9%\n\n\nNewcastle United (15/16)\n49,754\n2016-17\n51,106\n2.7%\n\n\nNorwich City (04/05)\n24,350\n2005-06\n24,952\n2.5%\n\n\nCrystal Palace (94/95)\n14,992\n1995-96\n15,248\n1.7%\n\n\nLuton Town (23/24)\n11,244\n2024-25\n11,420\n1.6%\n\n\nMiddlesbrough (96/97)\n29,848\n1997-98\n29,994\n0.5%\n\n\n\nAnd I have to give a shoutout to Burnley and, indeed, to Vincent Kompany because he certainly galvanised the supporters that season.\nA couple teams really jump out. Both Sunderland and Leicester City moved into new stadia the year after their relegation, and this gave them a considerable bump. They must have been absolutely packing out their stadia the season prior and had supporters banging down the doors to get in. Sunderland even managed to add over 5,000 supporters to their tally the season after relegation, despite the fact that they were still stuck in the Championship. Leicester also increased attendances in 2003-04, by 1,600 to 30,983. But they spent that season in the Premier League, so it’s less startling to see an increase.\nNewcastle also catch the eye. 51,106 fans during the 2016-17 is quite extraordinary. Newcastle’s fanbase has a reputation for diehard loyalty. It’s why many neutrals were happy to see them bought by the Saudis, despite misgivings about sportwashing. Indeed, Newcastle also have the second-highest post-relegation attendance - 43,388 during the 2009-2010 season. That particular season did see an 11% drop on the previous year’s PL average. And the contrast between 2016-17 and 2009-10 is enlightening. Similar to how Burnley fell under the spell of Vincent Kompany in 2022/23, Newcastle fans had a great relationship with Rafael Benitez - their manager from 2016 to 2019. Hired towards the end of their 2015/16 relegation season, it was considered quite a coup to attract Benitez to a Championship-bound club. And the fans showed their appreciation during his first full season in charge with record-breaking attendances.\nTypically, we start to see the cracks in season 2 outside the top flight. Filtering out teams like Leicester who were promoted at the first attempt and had Premier League fixtures to pull in the fans, only 6 teams see attendance figures in the black by season 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelegated Team (Season)\nAttd.\nAttd. year after\nLoss/Gain %\nAttd. 2 yrs. after\nLoss/Gain % 2 yrs.\n\n\n\n\nSunderland (96/97)\n20,865\n33,492\n60.5%\n38,745\n86%\n\n\nMiddlesbrough (92/93)\n16,724\n10,400\n-37.8%\n18,702\n11.8%\n\n\nCrystal Palace (94/95)\n14,992\n15,248\n1.7%\n16,085\n7.3%\n\n\nManchester City (95/96)\n27,869\n26,753\n-4.0%\n28,196\n1.2%\n\n\nNorwich City (04/05)\n24,350\n24,952\n2.5%\n24,545\n0.8%\n\n\nIpswich Town (01/02)\n24,426\n25,455\n4.2%\n24,520\n0.4%\n\n\n\nAgain, we have some anomalies. Middlesborough’s attendance nosedived in 1993-94 but they were undergoing a stadium rebuild. Basically, they had more stadium 2 years later. By 2017-18, Middlesborough were hosting 25,544 fans a game in the Championship and over 30,000 during their stint for the preceding year’s stint in the Prem. So their 10,400 fan turnout - heck, even their 18,702 fan turnout, are merely reflective of stadium constraints and not reflective of their true fanbase.\n\n\nNosedives\nmiddlesborough, oldham\n\n\nAnd in general?\nOn average, attendance falls significantly after relegation. The below table shows a 1st-year average decrease of 13.72%. And it shows that in the second year, there is an average decrease of 12.34%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague\nYear After Avg.

Superficially, the above data is reassuring. If you just look at the overalls, then it would seem attendances stabilise in Year 2 after relegation. You lose 15% of your attendance immediately after relegation, but at least it doesn’t get worse. But it does.\nIf you didn’t get promoted to the Premier League at the first time of asking and spend a 2nd year in the Championship, then you can expect to lose a further 8% of your Premier League attendance. And if you get relegated to League 1, that jumps above 10%. So it seems teams will stick with a team more resolutely in the year after their relegation, likely hoping for a successful season and a swift return. By Year 2, that optimism may fade and attendance figures dwindle still further. Let’s probe that performance factor further.\n\n\nDoes performance affect attendance?\nThe below table shows how the outcome of your first season post-relegation can impact attendance figures during that season.\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nChampionship\n-16.58%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-28.16%\n\n\nPL\n-5.84%\n\n\n2023/24 teams without year 2 data\n-4.07%\n\n\n   Burnley\n-7.29%\n\n\n   Luton Town\n1.57%\n\n\n   Sheffield United\n-6.47%\n\n\n\nEXCLUDING MIDDLESBOROUGH (93/94), LEICESTER (02/03) & SUNDERLAND (97/98)\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nChampionship\n-17.53%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-28.16%\n\n\nPL\n-8.15%\n\n\n2023/24 teams with unknown destination\n-4.07%\n\n\n   Burnley\n-7.29%\n\n\n   Luton Town\n1.57%\n\n\n   Sheffield United\n-6.47%\n\n\n\nIf your club isn’t on track to bounce straight back, then they can expect to lose around 17% of the previous years’ attendance. And if they are heading for back-to-back relegations, with a freefall to League 1, expect losses of 28.16%. If, however, they are in the hunt for promotion then the losses are considerably less. Teams bound for the Premier League only lose 5.84% (8.15% excluding the new-stadium teams). As you can see, the above data also excludes teams who were relegated in 2023/24 - Burnley, Luton, Sheffield United. However, I think it’s best to include them. Luton are likely to be relegated, Burnley are likely to be promoted, and Sheffield United will probably just miss out on the top 2 and console themselves with the playoffs. Since all 3 clubs have spent the entire season on these trajectories, it’s safe enough to incorporate their impact on the season’s attendances. So I will include them as Luton: relegated to League 1; Burnley and Sheffield United promoted to the Premier League.\nWith Burnley & Sheffield United as PL, and Luton as League 1\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n-13.72%\n\n\nChampionship\n-16.58%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-20.73%\n\n\nPL\n-5.92%\n\n\nGrand Total\n-13.72%\n\n\n\nWith Burnley & Sheffield United as PL, and Luton as League 1. EXCLUDING MIDDLESBOROUGH (93/94), LEICESTER (02/03) & SUNDERLAND (97/98)\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n-14.98%\n\n\nChampionship\n-17.53%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-20.73%\n\n\nPL\n-8.05%\n\n\nGrand Total\n-14.98%\n\n\n\nLuton really buck the trend for League 1-destined sides. And because there are so few teams who are relegated from the Premier League to League 1 in consecutive seasons, their outlier status has a huge impact on the data, dropping the averages by almost 8%. But can Luton really be considered anomalous when the data population is so small? In my view, yes. First of all, Luton had an emotional relegation season. Their captain Tom Lockyer suffered a cardiac arrest mid-game. Fortunately, he survived and has been on a road to recovery ever since with the view to playing again. Moreover, Luton battled very bravely against relegation despite these traumatising events and despite being financial minnows. Luton were a uniquely united club during their relegation season. However, that is not the only explanation. The other is that Luton are another stadium-constrained side. Kenilworth Road is famously tiny, and was a peculiar relic among Premier League stadiums. Luton have received approval for a stadium rebuild that will double its capacity. Based on their increased attendances post-relegation, Luton are another case of a club where demand has exceeded supply for some time.\nJust a quick note on Burnley, who were in the black during their Kompany-led campaign but have lost almost 8% this season. There are a few factors at play. First, morale sank during Kompany’s PL season. Burnley were truly awful and the core of their Championship-winning side was cast aside in favour of new recruits - an inexplicable decision in the view of many fans. Moreover, ALK capital - the ownership group - made some ill-judged and patronising comments to supporters for not bringing a positive enough atmosphere to Turf Moor. In a nutshell, the mood was bleak by the end of 2022-23. Kompany’s departure and subsequent replacement by Scott Parker failed to excite fans. Nor did selling half the first team squad and sitting through a million 0-0 draws. Despite the successful campaign, Parker-ball has been a bit of a slog. Sidenote: I was a huge Parker skeptic at first but I think he has brought the solidity Burnley needed and, as the season has gone on, a more cohesive team has taken shape, the football has yielded more goals and the fanbase has gotten on side. In any case, this all goes to highlight that there are complexities behind the averages I am presenting here."

Often these relate to stadium builds, but in other cases - like Newcastle and Burnley - it is just vibes at play.

The idea goes that young players are naive, innocent; they take risks, they express themselves, and in an ‘ignorance is bliss way’ they don’t show nerves the way older players do - or something.\nI guess the fearlessness theory rests on the presumption that young players think they have all the time in the world so a few blunders early on in their career won’t be the end of it. Or, there is so little pressure applied on them relative to senior players that they play with freedom and can ‘express themselves’. I can understand that to a certain extent, although young players could easily go in the other, overawed direction. 18 year old me would definitely have fallen into the shitting myself camp. But then, it could be argued that I don’t have the mentality of an elite athlete.\nIn any case, I’ve always been skeptical. They are young adults, not toddlers. And loads of promising young careers go up in smoke; the consequences for these players’ lives are devastating. Look at Jose Baxter, for example. I would imagine most young players have seen enough academy cohort colleagues fall by the wayside that they are acutely aware of their vulnerability. So I wanted to dig into this throwaway comment from pundits and find some way to interrogate it statistically."

That’s because another fairly common idea is that every elite player should be able to tuck away a penalty. And that, 12 yards from goal, it is nerves rather than technique which undoes the pro player.\nWhile the best way to explore fear would be penalty shootout data - where every single kick is critical - I haven’t got that and will make do with normal-time penalties. These don’t have quite the same almighty importance but they still tell us something about the effects of nerves.\nThis is part of a series of analyses I’m doing where I fixate on penalties. It just drives me crazy how prevalent they are. It increasingly like every final is decided on penalties and every match a penalty is awarded. And it’s not just because of VAR. Penalties per match have been increasing for some time. See Figure 1. Or the interactive version Figure 2 (more league data will be added). If you’d like to see a world where Penaldo doesn’t exist, this is my main project. It assess hat would happen if players who won the penalties were the only ones who got to take them, and it re-evaluates historical data to use non-penalty goals while crediting players who won penalties instead of the takers. I also throw in some assist analyses for good measure.

    "text": "Age bands\nFinally, I have constructed some age groupings. See . This is in order to prevent small samples for different ages giving unreliable values. For example, there is a 20% difference in the success rate for La Liga 19 year-olds compared 20 year-olds. However, given these age groups have relatively few attempts it’s easy for the data to get a little wild.\nI think the groups I have created are fairly logical. At the top and bottom end we’ve got open intervals - we can have players from 0 to 20; though the youngest penalty taker in this data is 17. And our 33+ group can go to infinity. Though the oldest penalty taker is .. This group are called No Fear At That Age? Because it’s the age when expectations are minimal, you are at your most naive, innocent, etc. And the elder statesmen are called Cherry on Top. I would theorise that they also have a bit less pressure, because they have already had a good career, and nobody is looking at their performance as a measure of their potential. They are a known quantity by this point.\nThey sandwich 3-year age bands. 21-23 could be the most pressurised age. That’s the point at which many wonderkid careers have gone awry - think Bojan Krkic. It’s the moment when you need to step up, mature, realise your potential and be consistent. Otherwise, a journeyman career in the lower leagues could await you. Then 24-26 could constitute the beginning of a player’s peak years. 27-29 would often be considered, depending a little on position, the absolute peak years of the average player. 30-32 has proven very fruitful for many players too. However, the perspective on these players definitely shifts. At this point, pressure amplifies because pundits and fans are often questioning whether you are ‘past it’, whether you should get a multi-year contract renewal or not. Just look at Mo Salah. In 2024/2025 he has having a career year but, at the age of 32, Liverpool have spent all season agonising about whether to give him a commensurate contract because of his age.\n\nCaveat\nOne enormous caveat, however, is that the ages provided by Stathead simply use the player’s age at the commencement of the season, not their age at the time of taking a penalty. Consequently, the oldest penalty taker in the dataset is Teddy Sheringham. He appears as 39 in my dataset, but he had recently turned 40 when he missed a final-day penalty for West Ham against Tottenham in the 2005/06 season. Jorge Molina also appears as 39 in my dataset, but he was 40 when he missed against Espanyol on the final day of the 2021/22 season, effectively relegating Granada from La Liga.\nSimilarly, the dataset indicates a 17 year-old - Bojan Krkic. But he was 18 by the time he took his penalty for Barcelona against Manchester United in the Champions League. This is all rather annoying, but it would be more trouble than it’s worth to separate out every single penalty from each player’s season statistics and dial in the taker’s age on a specific date. It just means there is a +/- of 9 months (i.e. the length of a season) for each player’s age."

Every penalty counts equally, so players who take more penalties have more influence. This measure tells us the true success rate of the group as a whole.\nUnweighted (player) mean: This is the simple average of individual players’ conversion rates. Each player counts equally, no matter how many penalties they have taken. This measure answers the question: what does the “average player” in this group look like?\n\nIn the charts shown here, the main benchmark (red dashed line) is the weighted overall mean, because it reflects the actual outcome of all penalties taken across the dataset."

Considering the lowest success rates are 20 and under, and 21-23 are 2nd-lowest, there is some indication that young players are not totally fearless. I think this could be particularly noteworthy because, players who are designated penalty takers at such a young are rare and they are, in all likelihood, technically gifted. Therefore, is it a psychological vulnerability that causes their penalty-taking to dip a little compared to their older peers? And that maybe they aren’t so impervious to fear as pundits may casually claim?\nLet’s see if this stands up to statistical scrutiny.\nData assembled from: Stathead\n\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nMethod\nEach penalty in the dataset is tied to a player, season, and league. Since some players take penalties in multiple seasons (or even in multiple leagues), the raw data contained repeated rows for the same player. To avoid overweighting those players, we collapsed the dataset to one row per player × age group × league, summing up penalties scored and attempted within each cell. This way, every player contributes fairly to the analysis.\nI used a logistic regression model because the outcome of interest—scoring or missing a penalty—is binary. Logistic regression lets us model the probability of success while accounting for the number of attempts in each cell. We tested age group, league, and their interaction to see if any of them had an effect on conversion rates. Confidence intervals were estimated around the predicted probabilities to judge how much overlap there was between groups.\n\n\nResults\nTo test whether penalty conversion varies by age or by league, I fit a logistic regression with both predictors and their interaction. The likelihood-ratio tests showed no evidence that either factor—or their combination—improves model fit (all p &gt; .4). In other words, neither age group nor league explains variation in conversion odds.\nPredicted probabilities were remarkably consistent across groups, generally hovering between 73% and 84%. For instance:\n\n≤20 years: 73–78% across leagues\n\n21–23 years: 71–79%\n\n27–29 years (peak): 77–79%\n\n33+ years: 74–84%\n\nConfidence intervals overlapped substantially, indicating no systematic age or league effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Group\nLeague\nPredicted Conversion Rate\n95% CI (Low)\n95% CI (High)\n\n\n\n\n33+: Cherry On Top\nEPL\n84.0%\n77.9%\n88.6%\n\n\n33+: Cherry On Top\nCL\n80.5%\n70.2%\n87.9%\n\n\n27-29: Peak Peak\nCL\n79.8%\n74.6%\n84.1%\n\n\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\nEPL\n79.1%\n75.4%\n82.5%\n\n\n24-26: Early Peak\nCL\n77.3%\n71.6%\n82.2%\n\n\n27-29: Peak Peak\nEPL\n78.7%\n75.7%\n81.4%\n\n\n24-26: Early Peak\nLa Liga\n78.8%\n75.9%\n81.4%\n\n\n30-32: Over The Hill?\nCL\n77.2%\n70.0%\n83.1%\n\n\n27-29: Peak Peak\nLa Liga\n77.3%\n74.3%\n80.0%\n\n\n24-26: Early Peak\nEPL\n78.4%\n75.5%\n81.1%\n\n\n30-32: Over The Hill?\nLa Liga\n78.3%\n74.5%\n81.6%\n\n\n30-32: Over The Hill?\nEPL\n78.2%\n74.3%\n81.6%\n\n\n≤20: No Fear At That Age?\nLa Liga\n77.8%\n67.5%\n85.5%\n\n\n≤20: No Fear At That Age?\nEPL\n75.0%\n64.4%\n83.3%\n\n\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\nLa Liga\n75.8%\n71.4%\n79.7%\n\n\n≤20: No Fear At That Age?\nCL\n73.2%\n57.7%\n84.5%\n\n\n33+: Cherry On Top\nLa Liga\n74.4%\n69.1%\n79.1%\n\n\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\nCL\n71.2%\n63.2%\n78.1%\n\n\n\nConversion rates by age group and league, sorted by predicted conversion rate (highest to lowest), with 95% confidence intervals."

    "text": "Originally published in the Brasov Visitor (now-defunct).\nIt’s official - Brasov County has an overpopulation of Brown Bears. 37 too many to be exact. So what do you do with three dozen large, hairy and hostile predators? That’s the quandry facing local government, environmentalists, hunters and forestry experts. The surfeit of bears has meant taking a fresh look at the local bear quota; the current legal hunting number is 20. But, on August 6 this year, a request was issued by the Prefecture of Brasov County, the Hunters and Anglers Association and the Forestry Institute for the re-assessment of the County bear quota. Arguing that the area’s biological balance is being disrupted by the 80 bears roaming the forests surrounding the city, the Prefecture is requesting either that the hunting number is increased to 37, or that some of the animals are relocated.\nThe cull controversy\nSerban Negus of the Brasov-based Forest Research Institute contends ‘our bear population is well above its natural level, and it is increasing far too fast.’ There are varying estimates for Romania’s bear population, most figures placing it in the region of 5,000 to 6,000. Biologists insist that 4,000 is the practical limit. So, Mr. Negus is not the only conservationist convinced that a bear cull is the answer. It may sound cold-hearted and extreme, but the practice is relatively routine in countries like Canada to halt any sharp rises in dominant populations.\nAnd it wouldn’t be the first time that such ruthless resolution was mooted. In October 2004, after a series of lethal rabid-bear attacks, Brasov mayor, George Scripcaru declared ‘these scavengers must be killed immediately before another attack happens – there is no other solution.’ So real were his threats that an online petition was established to prevent a cull.\nThe plight of the Brasov bear has received moderate international attention, often reflecting negatively on Romania’s relationship with what ought to be its prized asset. In the last few months alone publications such as The Globe and Mail (Canada) and The Times (England), together with US broadcaster MSNBC have all reported on antagonistic, man-bear relations in Brasov. Growing evidence that the stand-off is becoming more tense.\nFeast or famine\nBrasov’s current predicament is in stark contrast to Central Europe and even parts of Asia where Brown Bear populations are effectively extinct. In 2006 Germany became home to its first brown bear in 170 years (and may well be waiting 170 more to see another since he was promptly shot by hunters). Switzerland, too, spotted a bear recently, its first in over a century. They are keen to welcome more, while Italy, Austria and France have all gone to great expense in introducing widespread re-settlement projects.\nSuch projects could provide a solution for Brasov. Indeed Italy’s policy of importing bears from Slovenia is now a key factor in the bear debate. Worldwide, re-homing bears is becoming a very popular, biologically sustainable method of boosting regional bear populations. But, Brasov’s options for relocation are limited and some of the blame for this must fall on the local human population. Many of the present problems do not stem simply from too many bears; it is that they are nuisance bears.\nBears behaving badly\nExploitative and intrusive human activity has effectively established a new species of bear in Brasov; ‘binmen’ bears. And the reality of Ursus Delinquintus is far less romantic than the fabled Brown Bear. By deliberately enticing the bears into the city with a tempting smorgasbord of fresh garbage left out for easy grazing, and by merely regarding the bears as a cute tourist attraction, local people have unwittingly totally modified the natural instincts of the bears.\nApparently the problem dates back to the 70s, when Brasov first established its tourist credentials. The mountains with their resident bears, were its core selling-point. Bears remain somewhat unique to Romania, which is why hunters are so eager to bag them. In fact, after Ceausecu and Dracula, bears are the country’s most famous ‘residents’. During the Ceausescu days, they were hunted almost exclusively by his friends and family. Eliminating rivals perhaps?\nNow Brasov is paying the price. Just recently, a 20 year-old man was mauled by a bin-bound bear while sleeping on a park bench in the city. And, on the 15th May this year, a wandering bear and her cub halted downtown traffic for two hours. Attempts have been made to relocate delinquent bears to remote, sparsely populated locales which provide enough food to ensure they are no longer tempted to return to the cities.\nNo thank you\nThe stark reality is that the creation of this nuisance species has effectively eliminated the possibility of an export market. Nobody wants to bring in bears that will spend half their time in towns and cities rooting through your garbage. When you want them to head for the hills, they’ll stroll right back into towns for easy pickings. For this reason, plans to relocate Romania’s excess bears in Central Europe have not met with success. Which could leave hunting as the only answer\nLuring the hunters\nBears were, relatively speaking, quite secure during the Ceausescu dictatorship. Stringent anti-hunting laws were put in place to ensure there were always enough to sustain his hunting parties. His bloodthirsty bear-hoarding was actually a successful method of controlling their numbers. Nowadays, without Ceausescu and his Commie cronies, there just aren’t enough hunters to go around. But this is all about to change, thanks to a potentially savvy piece of business by the Romanian government; one of the few in Europe to legally and systematically promote bear-hunting licenses in problem areas. Aside from Russia, it is the only place in Europe worth even trying to go on a bear hunt. Throw in wolves and lynxes and you can see why the Romanian government are so keen, and uniquely positioned, to market their talismanic beasts.\nIn the absence of viable alternatives, hunting becomes a strange twist on eco-tourism, a lucrative cocktail of poaching and preservation. 333 bear licenses were sold last year, each bear going for between $15,000 and $23,000. Naturally, these are quite popular with Central European hunters. The problem is; it just isn’t enough. Even if the government succeeded in selling all available permits (which they don’t) there would still be a bear glut in Romania and Brasov.\nMore licenses could resolve the ‘bin-bear’ issue, provide valuable income and deliver the added benefits of offering security and sustainability for bear habitats at home and abroad. Naturally hunters at home and abroad are drooling over the possibility of lifting the restrictions. However Romania’s hands are tied somewhat since joining the EU, and their handling of the situation is forever under scrutiny. In recent years, high-profile figures have been critical of Romania’s policies, such as Jacques Chirac. Yet Western Europeans need to remember that bears kill, even whilst they may long for a bear population of their very own.\nHumans vs. the wild\nRomanians do not contemplate a cull of their iconic animal without reluctance. But it has now come down to a choice between bears and security, especially when a city encroaches on wild bear territory. After 40 years of mismanagement, culls and resettlement programmes alone will not guarantee safety. Further measures, such as electric fences, have been proposed. The Iron Curtain has come down, but the electric fence could soon be a feature of the Brasov forests.\n“Medvěd kamčatský” by Milaw is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0"

    "text": "Introduction\n‘How a society deals with its past has a major determining influence on whether that society will achieve long-term peace and stability’ (Sarkin, 2001). Discuss, paying attention to the models of justice in post-conflict Rwanda and South Africa.\nSarkin asserts approaches to dealing with past injustices determine whether transitional democracies realize long-term peace and stability1. Stability is consistent with positive peace: the absence of physical and structural violence alongside equal rights and civil trust2. This essay assesses progress towards these normative outcomes with reference to transitional justice in post-genocide Rwanda and post-apartheid South Africa.\nReconciliation is a mediating prerequisite of short-term (truth and justice) and long-term (peace and stability) justice mechanism objectives34. Chapman claims the short-term negative impacts of truth on reconciliation are outweighed by its longer-term necessity for nation-building5. Elon highlights friction between truth, justice and peace, contending that ‘a little forgetfulness might be in order’6 but, to Sarkin, post-genocide reprisal killings occurred ‘because the tragedy remains unresolved in terms of truth, justice and reconciliation’7; he stresses the negative impact of ‘collective amnesia’8. Mihai adds that institutions of democracy and law are discredited if legacies of human rights violations are not confronted. Further, trust and stability are undermined by moral hatreds; reproduced when victims’ demands for justice recognition are not acknowledged9. This, argues Kiss, ‘produces the cycles of distrust, hatred, and violence we have witnessed in…the Balkans, Rwanda, and the Middle East.’10 Demonstrating the limited empirical evidence to support the presumed merits of transitional justice, Skaar argues that universally-applicable justice models are a fallacy, alongside Betts in stressing contextual specificity1112.\nConsequently, this essay first addresses contextualization in formulations of justice models, then focuses on models adopted in Rwanda and South Africa. Overarching justice typologies are dichotomized as retributive and restorative. Retributive focuses on legal punishment. Restorative, through truth commissions, reparations and amnesties, is social justice: ‘concerned with restoring broken relationships.’13 Rwanda and South Africa reflect differing priorities which streamline existing disputes, highlighting inadequacy in absolute models. Academic trends suggest ability to implement the stabilizing tenets of ‘truth, justice and reconciliation’ can only be achieved by balancing both models14. The examples engage emergent emphases on victim reparations and informal, locally-administered justice initiatives15. Innovations and deficiencies are hereby identified through synthesized critiques of progress towards short and long-term goals. Through Honig’s ‘remainders’, I argue that dealing with the past is essential to breaking cycles of violence, victimization and bitterness; mishandling these legacies reinforces pre-existing fractures. Critical assessments are balanced by recognizing contributions to more innovative conceptualizations of justice models, which must sensitively acknowledge local circumstances. By exposing the inherent risks of dealing with the past future legacy-based initiatives towards peace and stability can be better informed.\n\nSarkin’s Transition Typologies\nSarkin identifies three transition typologies: reform, compromise, overthrow. Correlating with capacity constraints exemplified by justice contexts in Chile (‘ingeniously’16 restrictive), South Africa, and Rwanda respectively17, they determine mandates and resources for addressing past injustices. Within reform or compromise, the past retains influence, as perpetrators wield ‘military, judicial, and economic power.’18 In Chile and South Africa, outgoing parties negotiated privileged terms of transition19. Senior security personnel precluded significant retributive action by the incoming African National Congress (ANC), promising to make ‘a peaceful election totally impossible.’20 Chilean and South African perpetrators were thereby able to demand amnesties. After an overthrow transition, however, there are, Sarkin asserts, ‘no significant political constraints.’21\nYet inherent, near-universal limitations are imposed more generally by transition; scarcity of resources and under-staffed legal personnel examples amidst a litany of competing priorities for transitional governments seeking cohesion from instability22 23 24. These are compressed by time constraints, as ‘with the injustices of men…the longer they remain unrepaired, the greater become the obstacles to repairing them.’25 Moreover, time introduces complicated counterfactuals to calculations of retribution and reparation26, necessitating precise delineations of justice time-frames.\nBoth cases defied pre-existing conceptual rigidities and pursued innovative, expeditious resolutions of past injustices. In 2006, Elster described our present third phase in transitional justice evolution is demarcated by the decline in ‘spontaneous justice’ and increase in transnational learning27. Earlier Truth Commissions implemented in Argentina (1983-84) and Chile (90-91) necessarily compromised justice. Binding truth to conditionality of amnesty, South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) represented unprecedented ambition in its evolved conception of truth as the mechanism for justice28. The second aspect of Elster’s third phase is the international community’s increased role in upholding of justice and deterrence. However, ‘full development may well be blocked […] transitional justice is sure to exist in a tension between domestic and international forces.’29 Elster limits discussion of Rwanda to a suggestion that the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda (ICTR) will assist in developing a transnational legal framework30. Rather, Rwanda encompasses this contestation between domestic and international jurisdiction. It has overcome evident resource limitations31 in determination to try all suspected genocidaires."

    "text": "Innovations\n\nSouth Africa\nThe South African TRC was structurally unique in two significant ways. Unlike most Truth Commissions, South Africa’s model development was expressly democratic; the process was informed by those affected but pre-empted accusations of impartiality by acknowledging ANC culpability in human rights violations, subjecting themselves to the same procedures as pro-apartheid perpetrators. Representatives of the independent commission were publically-nominated and the process, endorsed by Parliamentary Act, emphasised transparency. Hearings were public. Secondly, determination to provide legal accountability, against the ‘crass impunity’ and ‘partial justice’ which affected victim support for the blanket-amnesty Chilean and Argentinean commissions, resulted in conditionality of amnesty32: ‘judicial stick and TRC carrot’33. Amnesty was individualised; perpetrators of gross violations were invited to apply within a 16-month window, exchanging full disclosure for criminal and civil court reprieve dependent on the qualifying criteria of political motivation. Personal motives were ineligible. This time-window forced the hand of prospective applicants; 7,116 applied, among whom 1,973 received a hearing and were confronted by their victims before the Commission. 1,167 amnesties were granted34.\nWhile recognizing its imposed limitations, the TRC’s Final Report supports restorative justice in explicit contrast to retribution, expressing the former’s superior facilitation of authoritative, inclusive truths. These extinguish lingering debate and restore the dignity of victims by officially acknowledging their ‘unknown narratives of apartheid’35. Kiss highlights the superiority of truths obtained through commission over trial, citing General Malan’s expansive TRC admissions relative to his earlier criminal trial, and potential chain-of-command accountability. For Kiss, ‘more dangerous, perhaps, than ignored injustices are distortions and disinformation’36. Crucially, the TRC could erode pre-existing stereotypes which, uninterrupted, would sustain social fractures. This was achieved through four categorizations of truth, balancing legalistic objectivity with more contextual, participatory and personal forms, towards reconciling ‘an acceptable truth…made and owned by the people.’37 Desmond Tutu’s reflections on contextualizing and understanding violence38 through new forms of truth are supported by Baumann’s assertion that divided societies must acknowledge the moral legitimacy of the ‘other’s’ violence in order to break from the past and fully address the dehumanizing effects of past injustices39. As evidenced by the Final Report’s exhaustive recommendations, the TRC’s accountability sought to explain culpability within broader frameworks of applicability and appease victim demands for justice through social transformation40.\nHayner argues that Truth Commissions attained popularity because of their superior ability to develop truth, peaceful reconciliation and human rights culture41. However, concrete linkages to justice had to be established. South Africa publicized perpetrators to an unprecedented degree, as well as investigating institutional accountability. Truth is an essential starting-point; it accurately distinguishes innocence from guilt, further combatting distrust by ‘breaking cycles of violence and oppression that characterize profoundly unjust societies.’42 Cognisant, however, of displaced criminal justice, a crucial component was the Reparation and Rehab Committee, which assisted social justice, healing and reconciliation through reparatory grants.[44] Efficacy and victim support are therefore contingent on fulfilling legal measures, reparations, and developmental reforms.\n\n\nRwanda\nIn the immediate aftermath of the genocide, the ICTR established jurisdiction over ‘high-level genocidaires’43 who committed crimes in 1994. Scorned by the national government (RPF) it has thusfar concluded 52 trials44. Nationally, Rwanda’s 1996 genocide law rejected earlier consideration of South Africa’s model, feeling reconciliation should wait for justice45. Retributive justice is considered instrumental in deterring future violence and fostering respect for human rights and rule of law. Catharsis derives from appeasing  victims’ desires for, and legal rights to, criminal justice46. Efforts towards indicting all 100,000 detainees (750,000 were eventually charged47) incarcerated for suspected association with the genocide4849 were undermined by resource limitations and a judiciary devastated by death and exile. By 2001 5,300 trials were concluded; prison overcrowding and resource drains prefaced the introduction of the recently-concluded gacaca courts for non-capital crimes ranging from looting to murder. Early optimism50 was predicated on (and, in some cases51, sustained by) four core features.\nFirstly, Tim Clark supports its efficiency in ‘delivering accountability for hundreds of thousands of génocidaires and acquitting tens of thousands of falsely accused suspects’52. Secondly, post-genocide Rwanda suffered mutual fear; the Tutsi minority feared democracy camouflaged genocide planning, while the Hutu majority feared justice pursued impartial vengeance (not helped by retaliatory killings) and consolidation of Tutsi power53. Gacaca courts thus suggested necessary awareness of truth and reconciliation54, embedding ‘strong restorative elements’ within a retributive framework. Gacaca was modelled on a traditional, pre-colonial system of informal community justice emphasizing public restoration and reparation. Rwanda’s state-sanctioned narrative concludes that ethnic fractures were a colonial ‘invention’55. A pre-colonial justice model elicits broader appeal than positivistic judicial structures56 disproportionately populated by the Tutsi through Hutu dispersal and perceived as colonial implants. As Kiss demonstrated with reference to TRC discourses of ‘forgiveness’ and ‘ubuntu’57, here Betts suggests that expiation and reconciliation relies on ritualistic and culturally-specific dimensions58. Gacaca constituted a symbolic reconciliatory platform stressing collective commonalities.\nThirdly, mass-participatory crimes necessitate mass-participatory reconciliation. To ‘fulfil the normative criteria of stability and social integration, it justice must be reoriented towards the community level’59. In October 2001, 254,000 ‘honourable’, lay locals were elected to oversee trials. Defendants were denied professional legal representation but could call witnesses; no formal evidence was required. Perpetrators were tried before the community where their alleged crimes were committed and, serving as witnesses and jurors, community attendance was compulsory. Empowered to deliver life sentences, perpetrators providing full confessions, apologies and implicating accomplices could nevertheless halve their sentences through outright reductions and community work60. As an open forum, the process contributes theoretically to ‘political and personal reconciliation…people are given the opportunity to confront their attackers, tell their stories and express pent-up emotions all in a secure environment.’61 Similar to Kenya’s customary law, Gacaca was legitimized through a privileged re-invention of tradition which differed markedly in its contemporary form; ‘highly regulated, national and involuntary’62, and ‘distinctly punitive’63. Indeed, limitations and superficialities have re-constituted social fractures threatening progress towards peace and stability in Rwanda and South Africa."

    "text": "Critiques\n\nJustice\nA common theme in transitional justice is subversion of due process64. All nationally-administered models (Hungary excepted) adapted existing rules of law to accommodate transitional prerogatives65. Some South African victims filed a lawsuit asserting their ‘rights to seek judicial redress had been unconstitutionally violated’66. Victim support waned with TRC considered legally empty. Political will shifted towards the emergent problem of ‘disaffected black youth’67: ex-combatants and children deprived of social and educational opportunities. Suppressed by security and judicial structures akin to pre-apartheid incarnations, legalistic inadequacies failed to institute new norms of ‘human rights thinking’68. Van der Merwe’s suggestion that victims’ views were misrepresented, and their rights compromised, in formulating post-apartheid justice mechanisms69 further explains the discrediting of South African justice.\nDefending gacaca from human rights critiques, Clark criticises ‘legal rigidity’70; fulfilling Rwanda’s retributive ambition, gacaca was a necessary innovation, he argues. However, its judicial powers should have acknowledged intrinsic limitations. Upholding life sentences when denying suspects legal representation and where standards of evidence are not exacting, is illegal, unjust, and fails to distinguish the present state as rights-conscious. Often, confessions were dismissed and life sentences applied71 based on subjective facts open to manipulation; instances of ‘disappearance, murder, bribery and intimidation’72 quickly surfaced. Further, judges were not competent to accurately assess complex legal cases. Conseillers juridiques assisted the lay judiciary but, owing to Tutsi monopoly, would institute ethnically-bounded understandings73. President Kagame himself acknowledges that every Rwandan was in some form affected by the genocide74. Their impartiality is therefore contingent on stringent legal norms. Yet the ‘honour’ of judges was monitored by the state75 and outcomes hereby normalized according to officially-promulgated narratives. The inadequacy of evidence reflects an attitude that ‘we don’t need truth, we know who did what’76. This linkage between victor’s truth and justice alerts us to Foucault’s regimes of truth, where states regulate the parameters of admissible truth77.\n\n\nTruth\nSouth Africa’s TRC has not succeeded in delivering authoritative truth. Underrepresentation of female and illiterate ‘truths’ reflects exclusion; indeed, the mandate, limited to gross physical rights violations, excluded structural violence78, and fixated on political motive79. Further, between 1990 and 1994 the Commission documents 5,695 murders but authorities estimate 14,00080. Victims were not always forthcoming and time constraints increasingly limited the rigour of hearings81.  As in Rwanda, some found the truth and reconciliation process traumatic rather than cathartic. Significantly, in both cases, ‘tactical storytelling’82 distorted the testimony of victim and perpetrator around plea-bargaining and reparation claims, leading to false guilt or limited testimony. Powerful groups, organizations and ethnic cliques collectively negotiated or colluded in formulating acceptable truths8384. Individualized applications could be framed as aberrations, thereby limiting structural accountability and limiting wider, public acknowledgement of ‘little perpetrator’ guilt. TRC credibility was undermined by Desmond Tutu’s support for Winnie Mandela’s incomplete truth (the ANC was similarly well-served by amnesty), contributing to Afrikaner perceptions that they were subject to a ‘witch-hunt.’85\nNevertheless, in stark contrast to the ANC, the incumbent RPF have refused to acknowledge any accountability for a ‘large number of persons, including women and children, reported to have been killed from 1994 onwards.’86 Despite exhortation by the UN Human Rights Committee to investigate, Kagame, himself evading two international arrest warrants, including suspected Hutu genocide in DR Congo’87, dismisses violations as individual transgressions addressed by internal procedures88. Exclusionary truths objectively perpetuate ethnic divides through ‘victim’/‘perpetrator’ rigidity but ‘any attempts to hold an ethnic group (in this case, Hutus) collectively responsible for all crimes will only lead to future acts of collective retaliatory violence’. The exclusionary RPF narrative regulates global, national and local justice implementations through which it is reciprocally legitimized and reinforced. This narrative is embedded at ingando solidarity education camps compulsory for students, genocide perpetrators and ex-combatants89. These enforce contestable causal relationships between colonists and stratification, and a genocide narrative which prevents Hutu victims from demanding universal justice alongside legislation denying political rivals access to elections under flimsy accusations of ‘genocide ideology’. Internationally, ‘genocide credit’ acquired through inaction guilt facilitates unconditional development loans and exclusion of RPF crimes in the ICTR90.\n\n\nRemainders\nSecure, open, and emic Chakravarti argues gacaca demonstrated unique potential for simultaneously embedding agonistic contestation and participatory reconciliation through mutual ‘understanding’ of the violence of ‘other’ and the divisiveness of ethnic categorizations. Hutu narratives emphasize engagement in civil war and their perceived subjugation by Tutsi pre-dating the colonial period. A mutual recognition of legitimate claims to ‘victim’, both through Hutu and RPF crimes, could assist reconciliation. However, judicial exclusion is upheld social-economically through forced relocations: ‘Rwanda’s history should have shown that an ethnicization of economic activities is something to be avoided if the country wants to evolve to a more peaceful future.’91 Recent developmental integration has not addressed imbalances. Rather, ‘stable’ depictions conceal a worsening in conditions for genocide survivors and the rural poor, retaining ‘the conditions of structural violence’92. South Africa’s ambitious yet flawed truths demonstrated reconciliatory value in eroding stereotypes. Former TRC member Yasmin Sooka, however, stresses the new inequalities and impunities which remained.93 Failure to provide proposed reparation payments dovetails with the immediate amnesty of perpetrators in sentiments of ‘double victimisation’94.\nBonnie Honig argues temporary political stability is secured through exclusionary structures which formulate legacies of unaddressed grievance, remainders. These mutate in conflict with the institutions of exclusion95.Warren Christopher, reducing Bosnia to ‘nothing but a matter of ancient hatred’,96 overlooks the fact that ‘ancient hatreds’ are sustained by analogistic retreats towards bounded historical narratives and divisive socio-economic connotations97. Their cyclical re-constitution could be addressed through agonistic models of individualized narrative to nuance ‘out-group’ understandings alongside developmental reform to erode rigid socio-economic generalisations. These reconciliatory mechanisms have been neglected in Rwanda and South Africa’s justice models. Consequently, remainders will mutate from the re-constitution of exclusionary institutions of truth and justice to undermine efforts towards peace and stability."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOf transitional democracies, only Spain adopted a ‘pact of forgetting’98. ‘Collective amnesia’ has re-emerged in acrimony and disunity, leading Baumann to conclude every society has to deal with its past.99 Legitimate victim claims for justice must be appeased through impartial, uncensored truths. These can erode conflict identities and promote trust through understanding. Perpetrators should be addressed according to individual violations, in tandem with wider social justice. South Africa made early strides towards narrative reconciliation, yet cycles of physical and structural violence must be halted by efficiently addressing the past, learning from it and enacting appropriate long-term reform; the building-blocks of reconciliation and stable peace. By inadequately doing so, both examples have re-constituted and re-embedded legacies of exclusion, their efforts undermined by political will and resource capacity. However, the examples provoke innovative conceptualizations of mechanisms bridging restorative and retributive justice. Engagement with the past must recognize contextual limitations and cultural specificities, developing reconciliation through community participation and developmental integration (social justice) while maintaining criminal justice through pragmatically-scaled ‘fair trials’. These represent the supposed contribution of the international community. Despite costing over US$1 billion they have not contributed positively to post-genocide Rwanda100. Too distant from the population to promote trust and reconciliation, international efforts are best directed towards capacity-building in affected societies; upholding accountability and deterrence by facilitating and monitoring impartial developmental and judicial structures effected at national and local level.101102"
