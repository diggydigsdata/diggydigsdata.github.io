    "text": "I’m a Burnley fan. With our recent promotion to the Premier League we are firmly consolidated as a yoyo club par excellence - we rank joint-4th with Sunderland on the Yoyo-meter (below). So what better time to assess some of the impacts of relegation from the Premier League? Because it’s never too early to plan ahead.\nIn this article, I’ll be exploring if, how and for how long Premier League relegation disrupts attendances. We’ll also examine some mitigating factors. Does attractive football help maintain attendances? Is mid-table mediocrity worse for attendances than being in a relegation dogfight?\nThe dataset I have designed for this project combines a few different online resources and also engineers some variables.

    "text": "Methodology\n\nData Collection\nFor this project, I gathered attendance, league position, and performance data for every club relegated from the Premier League, spanning a four-year period for each event:\n\nYear -1: The season before the Premier League relegation season.\nYear 0: The Premier League season that resulted in relegation.\nYear +1: The first season after relegation (in the Championship).\nYear +2: The second season after relegation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA temporary fifth year of data (Year +3) was programmatically generated to extract the league tier, which is used to determine the final outcome of the Year +2 season. After achieving that, the temporary Year +3 data was dropped.\n\n\n\nSources\n\nFor Attendance data, I referenced European-Football-Statistics.co.uk.\nFor both Position and Performance data I relied on the Fjelstul English Football Database, which is a comprehensive catalogue of English Football from 1888-2024. I used a small section from the standings dataset, but he also has datasets covering seasons, teams, matches, and appearances. Worth a look if you have a project in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDr. Fjelstul’s database is copyrighted (“© 2024 Joshua C. Fjelstul, Ph.D.”) but accessible via the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. I will also be making my own dataset available under the same CC-BY-SA 4.0 license.\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nIn addition to merging attendance data with position data and performance data, some key features of the dataset had to be engineered. I needed Year_vs_Relegation and Year_End_Outcome columns in order to group by season outcomes and to track attendance over time.\nFor my single source of truth dataset, I am using the raw values for performance (Points, Goals, etc.) and calculating per-game metrics as needed for analysis. Below is a snapshot of the final, tidy dataset.\n\nLimitations\nAs tidy as it is, there are still some pretty big limitations to this dataset:\nSeason-Level Granularity:\n- The dataset aggregates data at the season level, meaning any within-season events—such as managerial changes, mid-season form swings, or cup runs—are not captured.\nLoss of Match-Level Variability:\n- Attendance figures are averaged per season, so high- or low-attendance matches (e.g., local derbies) are smoothed out.\nExternal Influences Aren’t Captured (with the exception of COVID) - Factors such as weather, ticket pricing, fan protests, or extraordinary events (e.g., stadium closures) are not included. These could all contribute to unexplained variance in attendance. However, I do think that over a season, these sorts of things tend to balance themselves out. Except for COVID and stadium reconstructions, which both need special handling.\nHandling COVID-19\n- A quick note on the elephant in the stadium: the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. Since many games were played with zero or partial attendance, including them as “0” would catastrophically skew the averages. To prevent this, the data cleaning pipeline explicitly searches for any attendance data marked “COVID” and converts it to a null value (pd.NA). All subsequent averaging functions automatically ignore these null values, so the analysis is not contaminated by seasons played behind closed doors.\nHandling Stadium Anomalies The data contains three major structural anomalies where attendance was dictated by stadium construction, not fan sentiment or on-pitch performance:\n\nMiddlesbrough (1993-94): Attendance artificially plummeted due to a stadium rebuild.\nSunderland (1997-98): Attendance saw a massive, artificial spike from moving to the new Stadium of Light.\nLeicester City (2002-03): A similar spike occurred when the club moved to the Walkers Stadium (now called the King Power Stadium).\n\nTo prevent these outliers from skewing my interpretations, these specific team-seasons were identified. Unless I specifically mention their inclusion, you can safely assume they were filtered out of the analysis.\n\n\nDownloadable\nIf you still want the dataset for analysis after all that, or you’re wondering why I keep calling things tidy, then check out Too Messy to Melt for a technical guide to how this dataset was constructed. Or you can inspect the data dictionary and grab the downloadable dataset straight from my GitHub."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nIncreased attendance after relegation?\nLet’s start on a positive note. On 10 occasions, teams managed to increase their average attendance in the first season (Y+1) immediately following relegation.\n\n\n\n--- TABLE 1: Increased Attendance (Year +1) ---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam\nAttendance (Y0)\nAttendance (Y+1)\nChange (%)\n\n\n\n\nSunderland\n20865\n33492\n60.52\n\n\nLeicester City\n19835\n29231\n47.37\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n21910\n23051\n5.21\n\n\nIpswich Town\n24426\n25455\n4.21\n\n\nBurnley\n19399\n19953\n2.86\n\n\nNewcastle United\n49754\n51106\n2.72\n\n\nNorwich City\n24350\n24952\n2.47\n\n\nCrystal Palace\n14992\n15248\n1.71\n\n\nLuton Town\n11244\n11420\n1.57\n\n\nMiddlesbrough\n29848\n29994\n0.49\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I have to give a shoutout to Burnley and, indeed, to Vincent Kompany because he certainly galvanised the supporters that season.\nA couple teams really jump out. Both Sunderland and Leicester City moved into new stadia the year after their relegation, and this gave them a considerable bump. They must have been absolutely packing out their stadia the season prior and had supporters banging down the doors to get in. Sunderland even managed to add over 5,000 supporters to their tally the season after relegation, despite the fact that they were still stuck in the Championship. Leicester also increased attendances in 2003-04, by 1,600 to 30,983. But they spent that season in the Premier League, so it’s less startling to see an increase.\nNewcastle also catch the eye, but not just because their 51,106 fans in 2016-17 is an extraordinary number - everyone knows Newcastle is a football-mad city. What’s truly insightful is comparing their two most recent relegations.\n\nAfter relegation in 2009, the club saw a significant 11% drop in average attendance.\nAfter relegation in 2016-17, The club saw a 2.7% increase in attendance.\n\nThat’s 13.7-point swing. The club was massive in both scenarios, so “big club” is a constant. The most obvious variable is “vibes.”\nAt the end of 2008-09 Newcastle’s all-time record goalscorer and local lad Alan Shearer had stepped up to try and save Newcastle. He only had 8 games to do it in. No matter the outcome, he was supposed to stay on as manager into the next season. But they got relegated and he didn’t get offered a contract for the next season. There’s no doubt that this was a low point between Newcastle fans and their owner Mike Ashley. And this was borne out in the 2009-10 attendances.\n2016-17 was the polar opposite. Similar to how Burnley fell under the spell of Vincent Kompany in 2022/23, Newcastle fans had a great relationship with Rafael Benitez, even if Mike Ashley was still as loathed as ever. Benitez was hired towards the end of their 2015/16 relegation season and it was considered quite a coup to attract this Champions League-winning manager to a Championship-bound club. So the fans showed their appreciation during his first full season in charge with record-breaking attendances."

    "text": "Conclusions\n\nTeams can typically expect to lose 16-22% of their attendance after relegation if they don’t bounce straight back, and that drop accelerates in the second year.\nIf you are on track for promotion, losses are minimized to ~8% and attendance fully recovers upon returning to the Premier League.\n“Vibes” (like a popular manager) and “style” (attacking football) seem to be real factors, but their effect is most visible for teams stuck in mid-table, where the on-pitch result isn’t exciting enough on its own.\nAnd if you are on track for League 1, these losses are considerably higher\nRelegation doesn’t automatically mean fan abandonment. Context matters: management, entertainment value, stadium capacity, and hope for promotion all play a role."

    "section": "",
    "text": "‘There’s no fear at that age’ is a familiar refrain from pundits. The idea goes that young players are naive, innocent; they take risks, they express themselves, and in an ‘ignorance is bliss way’ they don’t show nerves the way older players do - or something.\nI guess the fearlessness theory rests on the presumption that young players think they have all the time in the world so a few blunders early on in their career won’t be the end of it. Or, there is so little pressure applied on them relative to senior players that they play with freedom and can ‘express themselves’. I can understand that to a certain extent, although young players could easily go in the other, overawed direction. 18 year old me would definitely have fallen into the shitting myself camp. But then, it could be argued that I don’t have the mentality of an elite athlete.\nNevertheless, I’ve always been skeptical. They are young adults, not toddlers. And loads of promising young careers go up in smoke; the consequences for these players’ lives are devastating. Look at Jose Baxter, for example. I would imagine most young players have seen enough academy cohort colleagues fall by the wayside that they are acutely aware of their vulnerability. So I wanted to dig into this throwaway comment from pundits and find some way to interrogate it statistically.\nThe metric that is the easiest to isolate as a corollary for fear is the penalty. That’s because another fairly common idea is that every elite player should be able to tuck away a penalty. And that, 12 yards from goal, it is nerves rather than technique which undoes the pro player. While the best way to explore fear would be penalty shootout data - where every single kick is critical - I haven’t got that and will normal-time penalties as a proxy. Of course, these don’t have quite the same almighty importance but they still tell us something about the effects of nerves.\nThis is part of a series of analyses I’m doing where I fixate on penalties. It just drives me crazy how prevalent they are. It increasingly like every final is decided on penalties and every match a penalty is awarded. And it’s not just because of VAR. These increases have been ongoing for some time. See Figure 1. Or the interactive version Figure 2, though I haven’t added many leagues so there’s not much to play around with. At time of writing, Harry Kane is having the season of his life - so the story goes - with 14 goals in 7 games. Astonishing, yes, but 6 of those have been penalties… Without penalties he’s at 8 in 7, which is still very good but well short of his current Dixie Dean trajectory. Anyway, I digress. If you’re interested, my main project is this one:\n\nWhat would happen if players who won the penalties were the only ones who got to take them? https://eoind.github.io/analytics/football/penalty_takers/\nAnd now for… are young players really fearless? What does the penalty data say? (read on to find out!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average penalties per match over time, by league (with global trend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2"

    "section": "Age bands",
    "text": "Age bands\nFinally, I have constructed some age groupings. See . This is in order to prevent small samples for different ages giving unreliable values. For example, there is a 20% difference in the success rate for La Liga 19 year-olds compared 20 year-olds. However, given these age groups have relatively few attempts it’s easy for the data to get a little wild.\nI think the groups I have created are fairly logical. At the top and bottom end we’ve got open intervals - we can have players from 0 to 20; though the youngest penalty taker in this data is 17. And our 33+ group can go to infinity. Though the oldest penalty taker is .. This group are called No Fear At That Age? Because it’s the age when expectations are minimal, you are at your most naive, innocent, etc. And the elder statesmen are called Cherry on Top. I would theorise that they also have a bit less pressure, because they have already had a good career, and nobody is looking at their performance as a measure of their potential. They are a known quantity by this point.\nThey sandwich 3-year age bands. 21-23 could be the most pressurised age. That’s the point at which many wonderkid careers have gone awry - think Bojan Krkic. It’s the moment when you need to step up, mature, realise your potential and be consistent. Otherwise, a journeyman career in the lower leagues could await you. Then 24-26 could constitute the beginning of a player’s peak years. 27-29 would often be considered, depending a little on position, the absolute peak years of the average player. 30-32 has proven very fruitful for many players too. However, the perspective on these players definitely shifts. At this point, pressure amplifies because pundits and fans are often questioning whether you are ‘past it’, whether you should get a multi-year contract renewal or not. Just look at Mo Salah. In 2024/2025 he has having a career year but, at the age of 32, Liverpool have spent all season agonising about whether to give him a commensurate contract because of his age.\n\nCaveat\nOne enormous caveat, however, is that the ages provided by Stathead simply use the player’s age at the commencement of the season, not their age at the time of taking a penalty. Consequently, the oldest penalty taker in the dataset is Teddy Sheringham. He appears as 39 in my dataset, but he had recently turned 40 when he missed a final-day penalty for West Ham against Tottenham in the 2005/06 season. Jorge Molina also appears as 39 in my dataset, but he was 40 when he missed against Espanyol on the final day of the 2021/22 season, effectively relegating Granada from La Liga.\nSimilarly, the dataset indicates a 17 year-old - Bojan Krkic. But he was 18 by the time he took his penalty for Barcelona against Manchester United in the Champions League. This is all rather annoying, but it would be more trouble than it’s worth to separate out every single penalty from each player’s season statistics and dial in the taker’s age on a specific date. It just means there is a +/- of 9 months (i.e. the length of a season) for each player’s age."

Every penalty counts equally, so players who take more penalties have more influence. This measure tells us the true success rate of the group as a whole.\nUnweighted (player) mean: This is the simple average of individual players’ conversion rates. Each player counts equally, no matter how many penalties they have taken. This measure answers the question: what does the “average player” in this group look like?\n\nIn the charts shown here, the main benchmark (red dashed line) is the weighted overall mean, because it reflects the actual outcome of all penalties taken across the dataset."

For the first time, the Cherry on Top vets aren’t the most effective penalty takers. In fact, in La Liga they are the worst. Meanwhile, the 20s and under are right up there near the top. And if we drill down into that age group, we can really appreciate how precocious those La Liga teens are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Group\nPenalty Attempts\nPenalty Conversions\nConversion Rate (%)\n\n\n\n\n&lt;=20: No Fear At That Age?\n81\n63\n77.78\n\n\n18\n10\n8\n80.00\n\n\n19\n27\n24\n88.89\n\n\n20\n44\n31\n70.45\n\n\n\nLet’s remove the 20 year olds. Now, La Liga teens have a success rate of 86%! Of course, there’s a caveat… That’s a population size of just 37. Ezequiel Garay - one of history’s great centre-back penalty takers and a stalwart of my FC Atlas team in Football Manager - accounts for 22% of the entire La Liga teenage penalty taking population. And Jose Antonio Reyes accounts for another 19%. All together, those two players - and their combined 92% success rate - represent 41% of the whole group.\nSo let’s bundle everything together and see what we get…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Group\nPenalty Attempts\nPenalty Conversions\nConversion Rate (%)\n\n\n\n\n&lt;=20: No Fear At That Age\n202\n153\n75.74\n\n\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\n1047\n804\n76.79\n\n\n24-26: Early Peak\n1901\n1491\n78.43\n\n\n27-29: Peak Peak\n1898\n1485\n78.24\n\n\n30-32: Over The Hill?\n1164\n909\n78.09\n\n\n33+: Cherry On Top\n561\n440\n78.43\n\n\nGrand Total\n6773\n5282\n77.99\n\n\n\nThere is a very mild indication that more experienced players do better than younger players. Considering the lowest success rates are 20 and under, and 21-23 are 2nd-lowest, there is some indication that young players are not totally fearless. I think this could be particularly noteworthy because, players who are designated penalty takers at such a young are rare and they are, in all likelihood, technically gifted. Therefore, is it a psychological vulnerability that causes their penalty-taking to dip a little compared to their older peers? And that maybe they aren’t so impervious to fear as pundits may casually claim?\nLet’s see if this stands up to statistical scrutiny.\nData assembled from: Stathead\n\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nMethod\nEach penalty in the dataset is tied to a player, season, and league. Since some players take penalties in multiple seasons (or even in multiple leagues), the raw data contained repeated rows for the same player. To avoid overweighting those players, we collapsed the dataset to one row per player × age group × league, summing up penalties scored and attempted within each cell. This way, every player contributes fairly to the analysis.\nI used a logistic regression model because the outcome of interest—scoring or missing a penalty—is binary. Logistic regression lets us model the probability of success while accounting for the number of attempts in each cell. We tested age group, league, and their interaction to see if any of them had an effect on conversion rates. Confidence intervals were estimated around the predicted probabilities to judge how much overlap there was between groups.\n\n\nResults\nTo test whether penalty conversion varies by age or by league, I fit a logistic regression with both predictors and their interaction. The likelihood-ratio tests showed no evidence that either factor—or their combination—improves model fit (all p &gt; .4).

    "text": "‘There’s no fear at that age’ is a familiar refrain from pundits. The idea goes that young players are naive, innocent; they take risks, they express themselves, and in an ‘ignorance is bliss way’ they don’t show nerves the way older players do - or something.\nI guess the fearlessness theory rests on the presumption that young players think they have all the time in the world so a few blunders early on in their career won’t be the end of it. Or, there is so little pressure applied on them relative to senior players that they play with freedom and can ‘express themselves’. I can understand that to a certain extent, although young players could easily go in the other, overawed direction. 18 year old me would definitely have fallen into the shitting myself camp. But then, it could be argued that I don’t have the mentality of an elite athlete.\nNevertheless, I’ve always been skeptical. They are young adults, not toddlers. And loads of promising young careers go up in smoke; the consequences for these players’ lives are devastating. Look at Jose Baxter, for example. I would imagine most young players have seen enough academy cohort colleagues fall by the wayside that they are acutely aware of their vulnerability. So I wanted to dig into this throwaway comment from pundits and find some way to interrogate it statistically.\nThe metric that is the easiest to isolate as a corollary for fear is the penalty. That’s because another fairly common idea is that every elite player should be able to tuck away a penalty. And that, 12 yards from goal, it is nerves rather than technique which undoes the pro player. While the best way to explore fear would be penalty shootout data - where every single kick is critical - I haven’t got that and will normal-time penalties as a proxy. Of course, these don’t have quite the same almighty importance but they still tell us something about the effects of nerves.\nThis is part of a series of analyses I’m doing where I fixate on penalties. It just drives me crazy how prevalent they are. It increasingly like every final is decided on penalties and every match a penalty is awarded. And it’s not just because of VAR. These increases have been ongoing for some time. See Figure 1. Or the interactive version Figure 2, though I haven’t added many leagues so there’s not much to play around with. At time of writing, Harry Kane is having the season of his life - so the story goes - with 14 goals in 7 games. Astonishing, yes, but 6 of those have been penalties… Without penalties he’s at 8 in 7, which is still very good but well short of his current Dixie Dean trajectory. Anyway, I digress. If you’re interested, my main project is this one:\n\nWhat would happen if players who won the penalties were the only ones who got to take them? https://eoind.github.io/analytics/football/penalty_takers/\nAnd now for… are young players really fearless? What does the penalty data say? (read on to find out!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average penalties per match over time, by league (with global trend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2"

    "section": "Age bands",
    "text": "Age bands\nFinally, I have constructed some age groupings. See . This is in order to prevent small samples for different ages giving unreliable values. For example, there is a 20% difference in the success rate for La Liga 19 year-olds compared 20 year-olds. However, given these age groups have relatively few attempts it’s easy for the data to get a little wild.\nI think the groups I have created are fairly logical. At the top and bottom end we’ve got open intervals - we can have players from 0 to 20; though the youngest penalty taker in this data is 17. And our 33+ group can go to infinity. Though the oldest penalty taker is .. This group are called No Fear At That Age? Because it’s the age when expectations are minimal, you are at your most naive, innocent, etc. And the elder statesmen are called Cherry on Top. I would theorise that they also have a bit less pressure, because they have already had a good career, and nobody is looking at their performance as a measure of their potential. They are a known quantity by this point.\nThey sandwich 3-year age bands. 21-23 could be the most pressurised age. That’s the point at which many wonderkid careers have gone awry - think Bojan Krkic. It’s the moment when you need to step up, mature, realise your potential and be consistent. Otherwise, a journeyman career in the lower leagues could await you. Then 24-26 could constitute the beginning of a player’s peak years. 27-29 would often be considered, depending a little on position, the absolute peak years of the average player. 30-32 has proven very fruitful for many players too. However, the perspective on these players definitely shifts. At this point, pressure amplifies because pundits and fans are often questioning whether you are ‘past it’, whether you should get a multi-year contract renewal or not. Just look at Mo Salah. In 2024/2025 he has having a career year but, at the age of 32, Liverpool have spent all season agonising about whether to give him a commensurate contract because of his age.\n\nCaveat\nOne enormous caveat, however, is that the ages provided by Stathead simply use the player’s age at the commencement of the season, not their age at the time of taking a penalty. Consequently, the oldest penalty taker in the dataset is Teddy Sheringham. He appears as 39 in my dataset, but he had recently turned 40 when he missed a final-day penalty for West Ham against Tottenham in the 2005/06 season. Jorge Molina also appears as 39 in my dataset, but he was 40 when he missed against Espanyol on the final day of the 2021/22 season, effectively relegating Granada from La Liga.\nSimilarly, the dataset indicates a 17 year-old - Bojan Krkic. But he was 18 by the time he took his penalty for Barcelona against Manchester United in the Champions League. This is all rather annoying, but it would be more trouble than it’s worth to separate out every single penalty from each player’s season statistics and dial in the taker’s age on a specific date. It just means there is a +/- of 9 months (i.e. the length of a season) for each player’s age."

Every penalty counts equally, so players who take more penalties have more influence. This measure tells us the true success rate of the group as a whole.\nUnweighted (player) mean: This is the simple average of individual players’ conversion rates. Each player counts equally, no matter how many penalties they have taken. This measure answers the question: what does the “average player” in this group look like?\n\nIn the charts shown here, the main benchmark (red dashed line) is the weighted overall mean, because it reflects the actual outcome of all penalties taken across the dataset."

For the first time, the Cherry on Top vets aren’t the most effective penalty takers. In fact, in La Liga they are the worst. Meanwhile, the 20s and under are right up there near the top. And if we drill down into that age group, we can really appreciate how precocious those La Liga teens are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Group\nPenalty Attempts\nPenalty Conversions\nConversion Rate (%)\n\n\n\n\n&lt;=20: No Fear At That Age?\n81\n63\n77.78\n\n\n18\n10\n8\n80.00\n\n\n19\n27\n24\n88.89\n\n\n20\n44\n31\n70.45\n\n\n\nLet’s remove the 20 year olds. Now, La Liga teens have a success rate of 86%! Of course, there’s a caveat… That’s a population size of just 37. Ezequiel Garay - one of history’s great centre-back penalty takers and a stalwart of my FC Atlas team in Football Manager - accounts for 22% of the entire La Liga teenage penalty taking population. And Jose Antonio Reyes accounts for another 19%. All together, those two players - and their combined 92% success rate - represent 41% of the whole group.\nSo let’s bundle everything together and see what we get…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Group\nPenalty Attempts\nPenalty Conversions\nConversion Rate (%)\n\n\n\n\n&lt;=20: No Fear At That Age\n202\n153\n75.74\n\n\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\n1047\n804\n76.79\n\n\n24-26: Early Peak\n1901\n1491\n78.43\n\n\n27-29: Peak Peak\n1898\n1485\n78.24\n\n\n30-32: Over The Hill?\n1164\n909\n78.09\n\n\n33+: Cherry On Top\n561\n440\n78.43\n\n\nGrand Total\n6773\n5282\n77.99\n\n\n\nThere is a very mild indication that more experienced players do better than younger players. Considering the lowest success rates are 20 and under, and 21-23 are 2nd-lowest, there is some indication that young players are not totally fearless. I think this could be particularly noteworthy because, players who are designated penalty takers at such a young are rare and they are, in all likelihood, technically gifted. Therefore, is it a psychological vulnerability that causes their penalty-taking to dip a little compared to their older peers? And that maybe they aren’t so impervious to fear as pundits may casually claim?\nLet’s see if this stands up to statistical scrutiny.\n\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nMethod\nEach penalty in the dataset is tied to a player, season, and league. Since some players take penalties in multiple seasons (or even in multiple leagues), the raw data contained repeated rows for the same player. To avoid overweighting those players, we collapsed the dataset to one row per player × age group × league, summing up penalties scored and attempted within each cell. This way, every player contributes fairly to the analysis.\nI used a logistic regression model because the outcome of interest—scoring or missing a penalty—is binary. Logistic regression lets us model the probability of success while accounting for the number of attempts in each cell. We tested age group, league, and their interaction to see if any of them had an effect on conversion rates. Confidence intervals were estimated around the predicted probabilities to judge how much overlap there was between groups.\n\n\nResults\nTo test whether penalty conversion varies by age or by league, I fit a logistic regression with both predictors and their interaction. The likelihood-ratio tests showed no evidence that either factor—or their combination—improves model fit (all p &gt; .4). In other words, neither age group nor league explains variation in conversion odds.\nPredicted probabilities were remarkably consistent across groups, generally hovering between 73% and 84%. For instance:\n\n≤20 years: 73–78% across leagues\n\n21–23 years: 71–79%\n\n27–29 years (peak): 77–79%\n\n33+ years: 74–84%\n\nConfidence intervals overlapped substantially, indicating no systematic age or league effect.\nNote: Bars show predicted conversion probabilities with 95% confidence intervals.

Both Sunderland and Leicester City moved into new stadia the year after their relegation, and this gave them a considerable bump. They must have been absolutely packing out their stadia the season prior and had supporters banging down the doors to get in. Sunderland even managed to add over 5,000 supporters to their tally the season after relegation, despite the fact that they were still stuck in the Championship. Leicester also increased attendances in 2003-04, by 1,600 to 30,983. But they spent that season in the Premier League, so it’s less startling to see an increase.\nNewcastle also catch the eye. 51,106 fans during the 2016-17 is quite extraordinary. Newcastle’s fanbase has a reputation for diehard loyalty. It’s why many neutrals were happy to see them bought by the Saudis, despite misgivings about sportwashing. Indeed, Newcastle also have the second-highest post-relegation attendance - 43,388 during the 2009-2010 season. That particular season did see an 11% drop on the previous year’s PL average. And the contrast between 2016-17 and 2009-10 is enlightening. Similar to how Burnley fell under the spell of Vincent Kompany in 2022/23, Newcastle fans had a great relationship with Rafael Benitez - their manager from 2016 to 2019. Hired towards the end of their 2015/16 relegation season, it was considered quite a coup to attract Benitez to a Championship-bound club. And the fans showed their appreciation during his first full season in charge with record-breaking attendances.\nTypically, we start to see the cracks in season 2 outside the top flight. Filtering out teams like Leicester who were promoted at the first attempt and had Premier League fixtures to pull in the fans, only 6 teams see attendance figures in the black by season 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelegated Team (Season)\nAttd.\nAttd. year after\nLoss/Gain %\nAttd. 2 yrs. after\nLoss/Gain % 2 yrs.\n\n\n\n\nSunderland (96/97)\n20,865\n33,492\n60.5%\n38,745\n86%\n\n\nMiddlesbrough (92/93)\n16,724\n10,400\n-37.8%\n18,702\n11.8%\n\n\nCrystal Palace (94/95)\n14,992\n15,248\n1.7%\n16,085\n7.3%\n\n\nManchester City (95/96)\n27,869\n26,753\n-4.0%\n28,196\n1.2%\n\n\nNorwich City (04/05)\n24,350\n24,952\n2.5%\n24,545\n0.8%\n\n\nIpswich Town (01/02)\n24,426\n25,455\n4.2%\n24,520\n0.4%\n\n\n\nAgain, we have some anomalies. Middlesborough’s attendance nosedived in 1993-94 but they were undergoing a stadium rebuild. Basically, they had more stadium 2 years later. By 2017-18, Middlesborough were hosting 25,544 fans a game in the Championship and over 30,000 during their stint for the preceding year’s stint in the Prem. So their 10,400 fan turnout - heck, even their 18,702 fan turnout, are merely reflective of stadium constraints and not reflective of their true fanbase.\n\n\nNosedives\nThis will include a mini investigation into Middlesborough and Oldham to find out why their attendances plummeted. I think there were explanatory factors.\n\n\nAnd in general?\nOn average, attendance falls significantly after relegation. The below table shows a 1st-year average decrease of 13.72%. And it shows that in the second year, there is an average decrease of 12.34%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague\nYear After Avg.

Superficially, the above data is reassuring. If you just look at the overalls, then it would seem attendances stabilise in Year 2 after relegation. You lose 15% of your attendance immediately after relegation, but at least it doesn’t get worse. But it does.\nIf you didn’t get promoted to the Premier League at the first time of asking and spend a 2nd year in the Championship, then you can expect to lose a further 8% of your Premier League attendance. And if you get relegated to League 1, that jumps above 10%. So it seems teams will stick with a team more resolutely in the year after their relegation, likely hoping for a successful season and a swift return. By Year 2, that optimism may fade and attendance figures dwindle still further. Let’s probe that performance factor further.\n\n\nDoes performance affect attendance?\nThe below table shows how the outcome of your first season post-relegation can impact attendance figures during that season.\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nChampionship\n-16.58%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-28.16%\n\n\nPL\n-5.84%\n\n\n2023/24 teams without year 2 data\n-4.07%\n\n\n   Burnley\n-7.29%\n\n\n   Luton Town\n1.57%\n\n\n   Sheffield United\n-6.47%\n\n\n\nEXCLUDING MIDDLESBOROUGH (93/94), LEICESTER (02/03) & SUNDERLAND (97/98)\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nChampionship\n-17.53%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-28.16%\n\n\nPL\n-8.15%\n\n\n2023/24 teams with unknown destination\n-4.07%\n\n\n   Burnley\n-7.29%\n\n\n   Luton Town\n1.57%\n\n\n   Sheffield United\n-6.47%\n\n\n\nIf your club isn’t on track to bounce straight back, then they can expect to lose around 17% of the previous years’ attendance. And if they are heading for back-to-back relegations, with a freefall to League 1, expect losses of 28.16%. If, however, they are in the hunt for promotion then the losses are considerably less. Teams bound for the Premier League only lose 5.84% (8.15% excluding the new-stadium teams). As you can see, the above data also excludes teams who were relegated in 2023/24 - Burnley, Luton, Sheffield United. However, I think it’s best to include them. Luton are likely to be relegated, Burnley are likely to be promoted, and Sheffield United will probably just miss out on the top 2 and console themselves with the playoffs. Since all 3 clubs have spent the entire season on these trajectories, it’s safe enough to incorporate their impact on the season’s attendances. So I will include them as Luton: relegated to League 1; Burnley and Sheffield United promoted to the Premier League.\nWith Burnley & Sheffield United as PL, and Luton as League 1\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n-13.72%\n\n\nChampionship\n-16.58%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-20.73%\n\n\nPL\n-5.92%\n\n\nGrand Total\n-13.72%\n\n\n\nWith Burnley & Sheffield United as PL, and Luton as League 1. EXCLUDING MIDDLESBOROUGH (93/94), LEICESTER (02/03) & SUNDERLAND (97/98)\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n-14.98%\n\n\nChampionship\n-17.53%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-20.73%\n\n\nPL\n-8.05%\n\n\nGrand Total\n-14.98%\n\n\n\nLuton really buck the trend for League 1-destined sides. And because there are so few teams who are relegated from the Premier League to League 1 in consecutive seasons, their outlier status has a huge impact on the data, dropping the averages by almost 8%. But can Luton really be considered anomalous when the data population is so small? In my view, yes. First of all, Luton had an emotional relegation season. Their captain Tom Lockyer suffered a cardiac arrest mid-game. Fortunately, he survived and has been on a road to recovery ever since with the view to playing again. Moreover, Luton battled very bravely against relegation despite these traumatising events and despite being financial minnows. Luton were a uniquely united club during their relegation season. However, that is not the only explanation. The other is that Luton are another stadium-constrained side. Kenilworth Road is famously tiny, and was a peculiar relic among Premier League stadiums. Luton have received approval for a stadium rebuild that will double its capacity. Based on their increased attendances post-relegation, Luton are another case of a club where demand has exceeded supply for some time.\nJust a quick note on Burnley, who were in the black during their Kompany-led campaign but have lost almost 8% this season. There are a few factors at play. First, morale sank during Kompany’s PL season. Burnley were truly awful and the core of their Championship-winning side was cast aside in favour of new recruits - an inexplicable decision in the view of many fans. Moreover, ALK capital - the ownership group - made some ill-judged and patronising comments to supporters for not bringing a positive enough atmosphere to Turf Moor. In a nutshell, the mood was bleak by the end of 2022-23. Kompany’s departure and subsequent replacement by Scott Parker failed to excite fans. Nor did selling half the first team squad and sitting through a million 0-0 draws. Despite the successful campaign, Parker-ball has been a bit of a slog. Sidenote: I was a huge Parker skeptic at first but I think he has brought the solidity Burnley needed and, as the season has gone on, a more cohesive team has taken shape, the football has yielded more goals and the fanbase has gotten on side. In any case, this all goes to highlight that there are complexities behind the averages I am presenting here."

Often these relate to stadium builds, but in other cases - like Newcastle and Burnley - it is just vibes at play. To really understand the data I would dig into each relegated team a little more to understand what underlying factors affect other teams because it’s possibly more nuanced than relegation = fanbandonment.\n\n\nThumbnail image courtesy of Jaroslav A.

The data shows that a toxic or broken relationship between a club’s owners and its fans can act as a powerful accelerant for an attendance collapse.\nThese aren’t just “bad vibes”; they are measurable, real-world events:\nHull City (2014-15): The -27% drop in Y+1 wasn’t just about relegation. It directly coincided with a fan mutiny over the owners’ deeply unpopular attempt to rebrand the club as “Hull Tigers.”\nBirmingham City (2007-08): A similar story. Their -27% nosedive in Y+1 was fueled by widespread fan protests calling for the board to resign.\nNewcastle (2009-10 vs. 2016-17): This is the perfect A/B test. In both 2009 and 2016, the club had the same toxic ownership under Mike Ashley.\nIn 2009-10, the vibe was poisonous. The result? A significant 11% drop in attendance.\nIn 2016-17, a different “vibe” won. Hiring (and keeping) Rafa Benitez was such an unexpected coup that his popularity papered over the cracks, galvanizing the fanbase and leading to a 2.7% increase.\nWimbledon (1999-2000): This is the ultimate case study. They were already a “homeless” club, playing at Crystal Palace’s Selhurst Park during their Y0 relegation season. Their baseline attendance was already depressed. When they lost their Premier League status, attendance collapsed by -59%. The showpiece occasion of a Premier League game seems to have been the last thread holding that displaced fanbase together. When it snapped, so did the club."
