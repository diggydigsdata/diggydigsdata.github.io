Both Sunderland and Leicester City moved into new stadia the year after their relegation, and this gave them a considerable bump. They must have been absolutely packing out their stadia the season prior and had supporters banging down the doors to get in. Sunderland even managed to add over 5,000 supporters to their tally the season after relegation, despite the fact that they were still stuck in the Championship. Leicester also increased attendances in 2003-04, by 1,600 to 30,983. But they spent that season in the Premier League, so it’s less startling to see an increase.\nNewcastle also catch the eye. 51,106 fans during the 2016-17 is quite extraordinary. Newcastle’s fanbase has a reputation for diehard loyalty. It’s why many neutrals were happy to see them bought by the Saudis, despite misgivings about sportwashing. Indeed, Newcastle also have the second-highest post-relegation attendance - 43,388 during the 2009-2010 season. That particular season did see an 11% drop on the previous year’s PL average. And the contrast between 2016-17 and 2009-10 is enlightening. Similar to how Burnley fell under the spell of Vincent Kompany in 2022/23, Newcastle fans had a great relationship with Rafael Benitez - their manager from 2016 to 2019. Hired towards the end of their 2015/16 relegation season, it was considered quite a coup to attract Benitez to a Championship-bound club. And the fans showed their appreciation during his first full season in charge with record-breaking attendances.\nTypically, we start to see the cracks in season 2 outside the top flight. Filtering out teams like Leicester who were promoted at the first attempt and had Premier League fixtures to pull in the fans, only 6 teams see attendance figures in the black by season 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelegated Team (Season)\nAttd.\nAttd. year after\nLoss/Gain %\nAttd. 2 yrs. after\nLoss/Gain % 2 yrs.\n\n\n\n\nSunderland (96/97)\n20,865\n33,492\n60.5%\n38,745\n86%\n\n\nMiddlesbrough (92/93)\n16,724\n10,400\n-37.8%\n18,702\n11.8%\n\n\nCrystal Palace (94/95)\n14,992\n15,248\n1.7%\n16,085\n7.3%\n\n\nManchester City (95/96)\n27,869\n26,753\n-4.0%\n28,196\n1.2%\n\n\nNorwich City (04/05)\n24,350\n24,952\n2.5%\n24,545\n0.8%\n\n\nIpswich Town (01/02)\n24,426\n25,455\n4.2%\n24,520\n0.4%\n\n\n\nAgain, we have some anomalies. Middlesborough’s attendance nosedived in 1993-94 but they were undergoing a stadium rebuild. Basically, they had more stadium 2 years later. By 2017-18, Middlesborough were hosting 25,544 fans a game in the Championship and over 30,000 during their stint for the preceding year’s stint in the Prem. So their 10,400 fan turnout - heck, even their 18,702 fan turnout, are merely reflective of stadium constraints and not reflective of their true fanbase.\n\n\nNosedives\nThis will include a mini investigation into Middlesborough and Oldham to find out why their attendances plummeted. I think there were explanatory factors.\n\n\nAnd in general?\nOn average, attendance falls significantly after relegation. The below table shows a 1st-year average decrease of 13.72%. And it shows that in the second year, there is an average decrease of 12.34%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague\nYear After Avg.

Superficially, the above data is reassuring. If you just look at the overalls, then it would seem attendances stabilise in Year 2 after relegation. You lose 15% of your attendance immediately after relegation, but at least it doesn’t get worse. But it does.\nIf you didn’t get promoted to the Premier League at the first time of asking and spend a 2nd year in the Championship, then you can expect to lose a further 8% of your Premier League attendance. And if you get relegated to League 1, that jumps above 10%. So it seems teams will stick with a team more resolutely in the year after their relegation, likely hoping for a successful season and a swift return. By Year 2, that optimism may fade and attendance figures dwindle still further. Let’s probe that performance factor further.\n\n\nDoes performance affect attendance?\nThe below table shows how the outcome of your first season post-relegation can impact attendance figures during that season.\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nChampionship\n-16.58%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-28.16%\n\n\nPL\n-5.84%\n\n\n2023/24 teams without year 2 data\n-4.07%\n\n\n   Burnley\n-7.29%\n\n\n   Luton Town\n1.57%\n\n\n   Sheffield United\n-6.47%\n\n\n\nEXCLUDING MIDDLESBOROUGH (93/94), LEICESTER (02/03) & SUNDERLAND (97/98)\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nChampionship\n-17.53%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-28.16%\n\n\nPL\n-8.15%\n\n\n2023/24 teams with unknown destination\n-4.07%\n\n\n   Burnley\n-7.29%\n\n\n   Luton Town\n1.57%\n\n\n   Sheffield United\n-6.47%\n\n\n\nIf your club isn’t on track to bounce straight back, then they can expect to lose around 17% of the previous years’ attendance. And if they are heading for back-to-back relegations, with a freefall to League 1, expect losses of 28.16%. If, however, they are in the hunt for promotion then the losses are considerably less. Teams bound for the Premier League only lose 5.84% (8.15% excluding the new-stadium teams). As you can see, the above data also excludes teams who were relegated in 2023/24 - Burnley, Luton, Sheffield United. However, I think it’s best to include them. Luton are likely to be relegated, Burnley are likely to be promoted, and Sheffield United will probably just miss out on the top 2 and console themselves with the playoffs. Since all 3 clubs have spent the entire season on these trajectories, it’s safe enough to incorporate their impact on the season’s attendances. So I will include them as Luton: relegated to League 1; Burnley and Sheffield United promoted to the Premier League.\nWith Burnley & Sheffield United as PL, and Luton as League 1\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n-13.72%\n\n\nChampionship\n-16.58%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-20.73%\n\n\nPL\n-5.92%\n\n\nGrand Total\n-13.72%\n\n\n\nWith Burnley & Sheffield United as PL, and Luton as League 1. EXCLUDING MIDDLESBOROUGH (93/94), LEICESTER (02/03) & SUNDERLAND (97/98)\n\n\n\nDestination during Championship Season\nAverage of Loss/Gain %\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n-14.98%\n\n\nChampionship\n-17.53%\n\n\nLeague 1\n-20.73%\n\n\nPL\n-8.05%\n\n\nGrand Total\n-14.98%\n\n\n\nLuton really buck the trend for League 1-destined sides. And because there are so few teams who are relegated from the Premier League to League 1 in consecutive seasons, their outlier status has a huge impact on the data, dropping the averages by almost 8%. But can Luton really be considered anomalous when the data population is so small? In my view, yes. First of all, Luton had an emotional relegation season. Their captain Tom Lockyer suffered a cardiac arrest mid-game. Fortunately, he survived and has been on a road to recovery ever since with the view to playing again. Moreover, Luton battled very bravely against relegation despite these traumatising events and despite being financial minnows. Luton were a uniquely united club during their relegation season. However, that is not the only explanation. The other is that Luton are another stadium-constrained side. Kenilworth Road is famously tiny, and was a peculiar relic among Premier League stadiums. Luton have received approval for a stadium rebuild that will double its capacity. Based on their increased attendances post-relegation, Luton are another case of a club where demand has exceeded supply for some time.\nJust a quick note on Burnley, who were in the black during their Kompany-led campaign but have lost almost 8% this season. There are a few factors at play. First, morale sank during Kompany’s PL season. Burnley were truly awful and the core of their Championship-winning side was cast aside in favour of new recruits - an inexplicable decision in the view of many fans. Moreover, ALK capital - the ownership group - made some ill-judged and patronising comments to supporters for not bringing a positive enough atmosphere to Turf Moor. In a nutshell, the mood was bleak by the end of 2022-23. Kompany’s departure and subsequent replacement by Scott Parker failed to excite fans. Nor did selling half the first team squad and sitting through a million 0-0 draws. Despite the successful campaign, Parker-ball has been a bit of a slog. Sidenote: I was a huge Parker skeptic at first but I think he has brought the solidity Burnley needed and, as the season has gone on, a more cohesive team has taken shape, the football has yielded more goals and the fanbase has gotten on side. In any case, this all goes to highlight that there are complexities behind the averages I am presenting here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "‘There’s no fear at that age’ is a familiar refrain from pundits. The idea goes that young players are naive, innocent; they take risks, they express themselves, and in an ‘ignorance is bliss way’ they don’t show nerves the way older players do - or something.\nI guess the fearlessness theory rests on the presumption that young players think they have all the time in the world so a few blunders early on in their career won’t be the end of it. Or, there is so little pressure applied on them relative to senior players that they play with freedom and can ‘express themselves’. I can understand that to a certain extent, although young players could easily go in the other, overawed direction. 18 year old me would definitely have fallen into the shitting myself camp. But then, it could be argued that I don’t have the mentality of an elite athlete.\nNevertheless, I’ve always been skeptical. They are young adults, not toddlers. And loads of promising young careers go up in smoke; the consequences for these players’ lives are devastating. Look at Jose Baxter, for example. I would imagine most young players have seen enough academy cohort colleagues fall by the wayside that they are acutely aware of their vulnerability. So I wanted to dig into this throwaway comment from pundits and find some way to interrogate it statistically.\nThe metric that is the easiest to isolate as a corollary for fear is the penalty. That’s because another fairly common idea is that every elite player should be able to tuck away a penalty. And that, 12 yards from goal, it is nerves rather than technique which undoes the pro player. While the best way to explore fear would be penalty shootout data - where every single kick is critical - I haven’t got that and will normal-time penalties as a proxy. Of course, these don’t have quite the same almighty importance but they still tell us something about the effects of nerves.\nThis is part of a series of analyses I’m doing where I fixate on penalties. It just drives me crazy how prevalent they are. It increasingly like every final is decided on penalties and every match a penalty is awarded. And it’s not just because of VAR. These increases have been ongoing for some time. See Figure 1. Or the interactive version Figure 2, though I haven’t added many leagues so there’s not much to play around with. At time of writing, Harry Kane is having the season of his life - so the story goes - with 14 goals in 7 games. Astonishing, yes, but 6 of those have been penalties… Without penalties he’s at 8 in 7, which is still very good but well short of his current Dixie Dean trajectory. Anyway, I digress. If you’re interested, my main project is this one:\n\nWhat would happen if players who won the penalties were the only ones who got to take them? https://eoind.github.io/analytics/football/penalty_takers/\nAnd now for… are young players really fearless? What does the penalty data say? (read on to find out!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average penalties per match over time, by league (with global trend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2"

    "text": "Age bands\nFinally, I have constructed some age groupings. See . This is in order to prevent small samples for different ages giving unreliable values. For example, there is a 20% difference in the success rate for La Liga 19 year-olds compared 20 year-olds. However, given these age groups have relatively few attempts it’s easy for the data to get a little wild.\nI think the groups I have created are fairly logical. At the top and bottom end we’ve got open intervals - we can have players from 0 to 20; though the youngest penalty taker in this data is 17. And our 33+ group can go to infinity. Though the oldest penalty taker is .. This group are called No Fear At That Age? Because it’s the age when expectations are minimal, you are at your most naive, innocent, etc. And the elder statesmen are called Cherry on Top. I would theorise that they also have a bit less pressure, because they have already had a good career, and nobody is looking at their performance as a measure of their potential. They are a known quantity by this point.\nThey sandwich 3-year age bands. 21-23 could be the most pressurised age. That’s the point at which many wonderkid careers have gone awry - think Bojan Krkic. It’s the moment when you need to step up, mature, realise your potential and be consistent. Otherwise, a journeyman career in the lower leagues could await you. Then 24-26 could constitute the beginning of a player’s peak years. 27-29 would often be considered, depending a little on position, the absolute peak years of the average player. 30-32 has proven very fruitful for many players too. However, the perspective on these players definitely shifts. At this point, pressure amplifies because pundits and fans are often questioning whether you are ‘past it’, whether you should get a multi-year contract renewal or not. Just look at Mo Salah. In 2024/2025 he has having a career year but, at the age of 32, Liverpool have spent all season agonising about whether to give him a commensurate contract because of his age.\n\nCaveat\nOne enormous caveat, however, is that the ages provided by Stathead simply use the player’s age at the commencement of the season, not their age at the time of taking a penalty. Consequently, the oldest penalty taker in the dataset is Teddy Sheringham. He appears as 39 in my dataset, but he had recently turned 40 when he missed a final-day penalty for West Ham against Tottenham in the 2005/06 season. Jorge Molina also appears as 39 in my dataset, but he was 40 when he missed against Espanyol on the final day of the 2021/22 season, effectively relegating Granada from La Liga.\nSimilarly, the dataset indicates a 17 year-old - Bojan Krkic. But he was 18 by the time he took his penalty for Barcelona against Manchester United in the Champions League. This is all rather annoying, but it would be more trouble than it’s worth to separate out every single penalty from each player’s season statistics and dial in the taker’s age on a specific date. It just means there is a +/- of 9 months (i.e. the length of a season) for each player’s age."

This measure tells us the true success rate of the group as a whole.\nUnweighted (player) mean: This is the simple average of individual players’ conversion rates.

    "section": "",
    "text": "‘There’s no fear at that age’ is a familiar refrain from pundits. The idea goes that young players are naive, innocent; they take risks, they express themselves, and in an ‘ignorance is bliss way’ they don’t show nerves the way older players do - or something.\nI guess the fearlessness theory rests on the presumption that young players think they have all the time in the world so a few blunders early on in their career won’t be the end of it. Or, there is so little pressure applied on them relative to senior players that they play with freedom and can ‘express themselves’. I can understand that to a certain extent, although young players could easily go in the other, overawed direction. 18 year old me would definitely have fallen into the shitting myself camp. But then, it could be argued that I don’t have the mentality of an elite athlete.\nNevertheless, I’ve always been skeptical. They are young adults, not toddlers. And loads of promising young careers go up in smoke; the consequences for these players’ lives are devastating. Look at Jose Baxter, for example. I would imagine most young players have seen enough academy cohort colleagues fall by the wayside that they are acutely aware of their vulnerability. So I wanted to dig into this throwaway comment from pundits and find some way to interrogate it statistically.\nThe metric that is the easiest to isolate as a corollary for fear is the penalty. That’s because another fairly common idea is that every elite player should be able to tuck away a penalty. And that, 12 yards from goal, it is nerves rather than technique which undoes the pro player. While the best way to explore fear would be penalty shootout data - where every single kick is critical - I haven’t got that and will normal-time penalties as a proxy. Of course, these don’t have quite the same almighty importance but they still tell us something about the effects of nerves.\nThis is part of a series of analyses I’m doing where I fixate on penalties. It just drives me crazy how prevalent they are. It increasingly like every final is decided on penalties and every match a penalty is awarded. And it’s not just because of VAR. These increases have been ongoing for some time. See Figure 1. Or the interactive version Figure 2, though I haven’t added many leagues so there’s not much to play around with. At time of writing, Harry Kane is having the season of his life - so the story goes - with 14 goals in 7 games. Astonishing, yes, but 6 of those have been penalties… Without penalties he’s at 8 in 7, which is still very good but well short of his current Dixie Dean trajectory. Anyway, I digress. If you’re interested, my main project is this one:\n\nWhat would happen if players who won the penalties were the only ones who got to take them? https://eoind.github.io/analytics/football/penalty_takers/\nAnd now for… are young players really fearless? What does the penalty data say? (read on to find out!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average penalties per match over time, by league (with global trend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 2"

    "text": "Age bands\nFinally, I have constructed some age groupings. See . This is in order to prevent small samples for different ages giving unreliable values. For example, there is a 20% difference in the success rate for La Liga 19 year-olds compared 20 year-olds. However, given these age groups have relatively few attempts it’s easy for the data to get a little wild.\nI think the groups I have created are fairly logical. At the top and bottom end we’ve got open intervals - we can have players from 0 to 20; though the youngest penalty taker in this data is 17. And our 33+ group can go to infinity. Though the oldest penalty taker is .. This group are called No Fear At That Age? Because it’s the age when expectations are minimal, you are at your most naive, innocent, etc. And the elder statesmen are called Cherry on Top. I would theorise that they also have a bit less pressure, because they have already had a good career, and nobody is looking at their performance as a measure of their potential. They are a known quantity by this point.\nThey sandwich 3-year age bands. 21-23 could be the most pressurised age. That’s the point at which many wonderkid careers have gone awry - think Bojan Krkic. It’s the moment when you need to step up, mature, realise your potential and be consistent. Otherwise, a journeyman career in the lower leagues could await you. Then 24-26 could constitute the beginning of a player’s peak years. 27-29 would often be considered, depending a little on position, the absolute peak years of the average player. 30-32 has proven very fruitful for many players too. However, the perspective on these players definitely shifts. At this point, pressure amplifies because pundits and fans are often questioning whether you are ‘past it’, whether you should get a multi-year contract renewal or not. Just look at Mo Salah. In 2024/2025 he has having a career year but, at the age of 32, Liverpool have spent all season agonising about whether to give him a commensurate contract because of his age.\n\nCaveat\nOne enormous caveat, however, is that the ages provided by Stathead simply use the player’s age at the commencement of the season, not their age at the time of taking a penalty. Consequently, the oldest penalty taker in the dataset is Teddy Sheringham. He appears as 39 in my dataset, but he had recently turned 40 when he missed a final-day penalty for West Ham against Tottenham in the 2005/06 season. Jorge Molina also appears as 39 in my dataset, but he was 40 when he missed against Espanyol on the final day of the 2021/22 season, effectively relegating Granada from La Liga.\nSimilarly, the dataset indicates a 17 year-old - Bojan Krkic. But he was 18 by the time he took his penalty for Barcelona against Manchester United in the Champions League. This is all rather annoying, but it would be more trouble than it’s worth to separate out every single penalty from each player’s season statistics and dial in the taker’s age on a specific date. It just means there is a +/- of 9 months (i.e. the length of a season) for each player’s age."

    "text": "Averages\nIn this analysis I calculate conversion rates in two different ways, which reflect slightly different questions:\n\nWeighted (overall) mean: This is the percentage of all penalties scored divided by the total penalties attempted within a group (e.g. a competition). Every penalty counts equally, so players who take more penalties have more influence. This measure tells us the true success rate of the group as a whole.\nUnweighted (player) mean: This is the simple average of individual players’ conversion rates. Each player counts equally, no matter how many penalties they have taken. This measure answers the question: what does the “average player” in this group look like?\n\nIn the charts shown here, the main benchmark (red dashed line) is the weighted overall mean, because it reflects the actual outcome of all penalties taken across the dataset."

The dashed line indicates the overall average (~78%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconversion by age\n\n\n\nage_group\nComp\npred_prob\nci_low\nci_high\n\n\n\n\n720\n&lt;=20: No Fear At That Age?\nCL\n0.731707\n0.577484\n0.844769\n\n\n721\n&lt;=20: No Fear At That Age?\nEPL\n0.750000\n0.643950\n0.832670\n\n\n452\n&lt;=20: No Fear At That Age?\nLa Liga\n0.777778\n0.674573\n0.855275\n\n\n309\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\nCL\n0.712230\n0.631588\n0.781332\n\n\n94\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\nEPL\n0.791252\n0.753518\n0.824555\n\n\n41\n21-23: Not A Kid Anymore\nLa Liga\n0.758025\n0.713916\n0.797264\n\n\n258\n24-26: Early Peak\nCL\n0.773109\n0.715574\n0.821903\n\n\n7\n24-26: Early Peak\nEPL\n0.784173\n0.754948\n0.810785\n\n\n26\n24-26: Early Peak\nLa Liga\n0.787696\n0.758529\n0.814203\n\n\n333\n27-29: Peak Peak\nCL\n0.797794\n0.745865\n0.841369\n\n\n10\n27-29: Peak Peak\nEPL\n0.786885\n0.756998\n0.814000\n\n\n83\n27-29: Peak Peak\nLa Liga\n0.773109\n0.743418\n0.800288\n\n\n498\n30-32: Over The Hill?\nCL\n0.772152\n0.700306\n0.830932\n\n\n517\n30-32: Over The Hill?\nEPL\n0.781818\n0.743263\n0.816017\n\n\n68\n30-32: Over The Hill?\nLa Liga\n0.782779\n0.744914\n0.816408\n\n\n807\n33+: Cherry On Top\nCL\n0.805195\n0.701640\n0.879006\n\n\n520\n33+: Cherry On Top\nEPL\n0.839572\n0.779802\n0.885500\n\n\n773\n33+: Cherry On Top\nLa Liga\n0.744108\n0.691427\n0.790519\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\n\nImage: 中国新闻社, CC BY 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nData assembled from: Stathead"
