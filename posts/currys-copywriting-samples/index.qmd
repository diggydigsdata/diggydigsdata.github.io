A compilation of some ecommerce copy I wrote while working as a copywriter for [Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk). I wrote about everything and anything - particularly computing.

Some links will inevitably break over time. Increasingly, these products are no longer on the main Currys site. But archived products often sit on Currys Business - the ugly duckling sibling site - to wither and rot. Where I've used a Currys Business link, the neglected product would be especially grateful to receive your visit.

My name isn't on any of these, but I promise I wrote them!
